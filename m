I'm well aware that you were asked to do so and that one reason was that
subsequent patches started deleting code that was added in previous ones
(hence my suspicion of circular dependencies and that splitting up things might
not be super trivial).

I don't think you were asked to go back and forth, but whether you see a
reasonable way to break things down a bit, where "reasonable" means without
deleting code that was just added.

I think mostly they do, but maintainers and reviewers are rather busy people.
So, I don't think you can expect everyone to follow every thread, especially
when they get lengthy.

I suggest to investigate whether it can be split it up in a reasonable way and
subsequently answer the question.

With your contribution you attempt to add a rather large portion of pretty core
code. This isn't an easy task and quite some discussion is totally expected;
please don't get frustrated, the series goes pretty well. :)

See below.

I think this could just use write!() and fwnode_get_name(), right?

This one is indeed a bit more tricky, because it comes from
fwnode_full_name_string() in lib/vsprintf.c.

Maybe it would be better to replicate the loop within fwnode_full_name_string()
and call write! from there.

Yeah, if we keep this approach, I'd prefer a more descriptive name.

However, I'd like to hear some more opinions from other members of the Rust team
on this one.
