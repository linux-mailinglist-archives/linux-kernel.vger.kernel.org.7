USB4 should be called an alt-mode though based on its behavior and I
think the spec makes a mistake not doing so. It's mutually exclusive
with alternate modes, it modifies the functionality of the data lanes
and it's not a new data mode (just a tunneling protocol). But that's
an aside for this patch...

Userspace "can" do it but it is not doing it today. There is no
userspace alt-mode manager (that I'm aware of) that's writing to
/sys/class/typec (typecd in ChromeOS only reads and does mode
entry/exit via a sideband mechanism) and boltd (userspace thunderbolt
manager; https://github.com/gicmo/bolt) only deals with tunnels and
not mode entry directly.

I think the inclusion of TBT and USB4 in the kernel makes this change
necessary and the existing way of doing it is not widely used yet.

There were some previous discussions on this:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/ZyjW0CMXgGIt-usC@kuha.fi.intel.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/chrome-platform/CAA8EJpqiF_0bgYT8boFa4UPJWcxgw89mmf=
bdMVKeAP-xnFOP4g@mail.gmail.com/

Some background:
* The Type-C port driver will add a partner alt-mode to the altmode bus.
* An altmode driver will probe and attach if available on the system.
    * Currently, the probe function of these altmode drivers always
enter the given mode. The expectation is that if a system allows mode
override, it should always be done by the alt mode driver. This
doesn't scale beyond one alt-mode driver =E2=80=93 between DP and TBT, whic=
h
altmode driver should win entry? Prior to TBT driver being added in
December and USB4 support circa similar time frame, DP was always the
default choice if override was supported.
    * Userspace could make this decision but then what about USB4? The
current APIs don't expose USB4 information in the same way and the
auto-enter behavior is different (it doesn't enter).

In a lot of existing designs, mode entry is entirely handled by the
firmware and no mode selection is possible from the kernel. This is
covered by patch 3 of this series (alt_mode_override) flag. Windows
designs usually fall into this category as they use PD controllers
implementing UCSI (and usually a very old UCSI version 1.2).

A few designs allow overriding the current mode:
* Chromebooks with cros_ec_ucsi which support Thunderbolt will allow
override of the alternate mode (via UCSI set_new_cam) and USB mode
(via UCSI Set_USB). They will enter DPAM instead of TBT by default if
possible.
* Chromebooks with the cros_ec_typec driver which support Thunderbolt
will require the OS to make the mode entry decision (no mode entry by
default on attach).
* Pixel phone TCPM currently requires mode entry from the kernel as
there's no userspace mode selection component.
* Potentially some Windows designs that implement AltMode override via
UCSI (ucsi_acpi). These should behave similarly to cros_ec_ucsi but
will likely automatically enter TBT mode.

In these cases, the kernel is a better place to make alternate mode decisio=
ns:
* Quicker than having a userspace implementation (and more consistent
during boot).
* Works consistently across drivers and accounts for both overridable
and non-overridable systems.

The main thing userspace should really be doing with mode entry is
setting policy around what modes they want to enter instead of doing
low level checking of compatibility and sequencing of mode entry
operations. And the main policy we're trying to enforce on ChromeOS is
to not enter TBT by default (based on our security posture described
at https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/securit=
y/usb4/).

Given that Thunderbolt altmode driver support and USB4 support was
only added around December of last year, I don't imagine there are
many userspace usages yet and we should fix these API issues before
they become too widely used. I think mode sequencing belongs in the
kernel and not userspace.

While the current sysfs apis for altmode + usb are useful for testing,
they aren't as useful for normal user use-cases. Deprecating or moving
this control to debugfs and only exposing the
mode_selection/mode_priority fields would be my choice going forward.
The mode selection work currently does go through the same typec APIs
as the sysfs entries so we gain test coverage of driver behavior using
either API. If we need to retain the old APIs, I think we'll need to
add some Kunit tests to make sure behavior is consistent across the
two ways of doing things.
