In November last year, I sent an RFC to introduce CAN XL [1]. That
RFC, despite positive feedback, was put on hold due to some unanswered
question concerning the PWM encoding [2].

While stuck, some small preparation work was done in parallel in [3]
by refactoring the struct can_priv and doing some trivial clean-up and
renaming. Initially, [3] received zero feedback but was eventually
merged after splitting it in smaller parts and resending it.

Finally, in July this year, we clarified the remaining mysteries about
PWM calculation, thus unlocking the series. Summer being a bit busy
because of some personal matters brings us to now.

After doing all the refactoring and adding all the CAN XL features,
the final result is roughly 30 patches, probably too much for a single
series. So I am splitting it in two:

  - preparation (this series)
  - CAN XL (will come later, after this series get ACK-ed)

And so, this series continues and finishes the preparation work done
in [3]. It contains all the refactoring needed to smoothly introduce
CAN XL. The goal is to:

  - split the functions in smaller pieces: CAN XL will introduce a
    fair amount of code. And some functions which are already fairly
    long (86 lines for can_validate(), 216 lines for can_changelink())
    would grow to disproportionate sizes if the CAN XL logic were to
    be inlined in those functions.

  - repurpose the existing code to handle both CAN FD and CAN XL: a
    huge part of CAN XL simply reuses the CAN FD logic. All the
    existing CAN FD logic is made more generic to handle both CAN FD
    and XL.

In more details:

  - Patch #1 moves struct data_bittiming_params from dev.h to
    bittiming.h and patch #2 makes can_get_relative_tdco() FD agnostic
    before also moving it to bittiming.h.

  - Patch #3 adds some comments to netlink.h tagging which IFLA
    symbols are FD specific.

  - Patches #4 to #6 are refactoring can_validate() and
    can_validate_bittiming().

  - Patches #7 to #11 are refactoring can_changelink() and
    can_tdc_changelink().

  - Patches #12 and #13 are refactoring can_get_size() and
    can_tdc_get_size().

  - Patches #14 to #17 are refactoring can_fill_info() and
    can_tdc_fill_info().

  - Patch #18 makes can_calc_tdco() FD agnostic.

  - Patch #19 adds can_get_ctrlmode_str() which converts control mode
    flags into strings. This is done in preparation of patch #20.

  - Patch #20 is the final patch and improves the user experience by
    providing detailed error messages whenever invalid parameters are
    provided. All those error messages came into handy when debugging
    the upcoming CAN XL patches.

Aside from the last patch, the other changes do not impact any of the
existing functionalities.

The follow up series which introduces CAN XL is nearly completed but
will be sent only once this one is approved: one thing at a time, I do
not want to overwhelm people (including myself).

Changes in v2:

  - Move can_validate()'s comment block to can_validate_databittiming().
    Consequently,

      [PATCH 07/21] can: netlink: remove comment in can_validate()

    from v1 is removed.

  - Change any occurrences of WARN_ON(1) into return -EOPNOTSUPP to
    suppress the three gcc warnings which were reported by the kernel
    test robot:

  - Small rewrite of patch #12 "can: netlink: make can_tdc_get_size()
    FD agnostic" description to add more details.
