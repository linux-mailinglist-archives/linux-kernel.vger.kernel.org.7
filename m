Normal reads and writes would also hang in an uninterruptible sleep if a 
path stops responding.

What exactly do you mean? You say "you could have dm-mpath 'handle' IO 
errors by failing the active path for "path errors".

Christoph doesn't want dm-mpath can't look at the error code - so dm-mpath 
doesn't know if path error occured or not. qemu could look at the error 
code, but qemu doesn't know which path did the SG_IO go through - so it 
can't instruct qemu to fail that path.

One of the possibility that we discussed was to add a path-id to SG_IO, so 
that dm-mpath would mark which path did the SG_IO go through and qemu 
could instruct dm-mpath to fail that path. But we rejected it as being 
more complicated than the current approach.
