I think (or, hope) it would also be not very worthless or rude to mention other
existing and ongoing works that have potentials to serve for similar purpose or
collaborate in future, here.

DAMON is designed for a sort of multi-source access information handling.  In
LSFMM, I proposed[1] damon_report_access() interface for making it easier to be
extended for more types of access information.  Currenlty damon_report_access()
is under early development.  I think this has a potential to serve something
similar to your single source goal.

Also in LSFMM, I proposed damos_add_folio() for a case that callers want to
utilize DAMON worker thread (kdamond) as an asynchronous memory
management operations execution thread while using its other features such as
[auto-tuned] quotas.  I think this has a potential to serve something similar
to your migration threads.  I haven't started damos_add_folio() development
yet, though.

I remember we discussed about DAMON on mailing list and in LSFMM a bit, on your
session.  IIRC, you were also looking for a time to see if there is a chance to
use DAMON in some way.  Due to the technical issue, we were unable to discuss
on the two new proposals on my LSFMM session, and it has been a bit while since
our last discussion.  So if you don't mind, I'd like to ask if you have some
opinions or comments about these.
