In my use case, I think a restrictive inheritance model could
be sufficient. My argument was mainly based on the fact that most cgroup
resource distribution mechanisms usually follow a parent→child restrictive
pattern. Through the review, I came to the view that I should adhere to the
common behavior whenever possible.

Firstly(on RFC), I initially supported allowing parent/child inconsistency
for flexibility, so I actually agree with your view regarding flexibility.
For the examples you mentioned, I have no disagreement. I think my final
understanding is aligned with yours.

Oh! I think you are a good reviewer :D
Okay then, Let me explain my preference for numeric tiers in more detail.
It seems we are aligned on the implementation strategy with bitmask,
but I think our difference lies in the interface style — 'name' vs.
'numeric increase'."

1. A simple numeric interface makes the usage more straightforward.
   Instead of '+/-' semantics, directly listing the numeric range feels
   clearer and easier to use. For example:

     tier 1 (ram)
     tier 2 (ssd)
     tier 3 (hdd)
     tier 4 (network device)
     tier 5 (some device)
     tier 6 (some device2)

   cg1: echo 1-3  > memory.swap.tier (ram,ssd,hdd)
   cg1/cg2: 2-4,6  > memory.swap.tie (ssd,hdd,network device, somedevice 2, assuming non-subset is allowed)

   Tier specification can also be expressed simply as arrays of priority
   ranges, which feels easy to understand.

2. Since tiers are inherently ordered, numbering fits naturally and is
   easier for users to accept.  
   In my view, assigning a name is mainly useful to distinguish between
   otherwise 'indistinguishable' groups, but in this case, there is already
   a clear distinction given by the different priorities which simply be 
   charaterized by increasing number.

I understand your point that tier names may be more convenient for
administrators, and I see the value in that. That was why I used the word
"reconsider" — your feedback makes sense as well.

I do not have a strong preference. It would be good to align after
considering the pros and cons. I look forward to your thoughts."

I see your point. In practice, when tiers are already being referenced
by cgroups, swap devices may come and go within those tiers. I think
this can be considered a "natural" behavior, as swap management is
usually performed explicitly by the administrator.  

From that perspective, I expect that unintended behavior is very
unlikely to occur in real scenarios. So I am comfortable assuming this
implicit behavior when reasoning about tier modifications.  

Thanks again for the clarification. With this, the overall picture
feels much clearer. Once we reach alignment on the "named" vs. "numeric"
tier interface, I plan to move forward with the patch work.
