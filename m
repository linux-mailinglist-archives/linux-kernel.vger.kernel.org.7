The test above is part of the smoke testing I do for nouveau, but I haven't seen
such issues yet for nouveau.

Well, you said that you never had this issue with "real" workloads, but only
with VK CTS, so I really think we should know what we are trying to fix here.

We can't just add new generic infrastructure without reasonable and *well
understood* justification.

I still don't understand why the kernel must throttle this? If userspace uses
async VM_BIND, it obviously can't spam the kernel infinitely without running
into an OOM case.

But let's assume we agree that we want to avoid that userspace can ever OOM itself
through async VM_BIND, then the proposed solution seems wrong:

Do we really want the driver developer to set an arbitrary boundary of a number
of jobs that can be submitted before *async* VM_BIND blocks and becomes
semi-sync?

How do we choose this number of jobs? A very small number to be safe, which
scales badly on powerful machines? A large number that scales well on powerful
machines, but OOMs on weaker ones?

I really think, this isn't the correct solution, but more a workaround.

For the context we're discussing this isn't different to other drivers supporing
async VM_BIND utilizing it from the host, rather than from a guest.

So, my original statement about nouveau, Xe, panthor doing the same thing
without running into trouble should be valid.
