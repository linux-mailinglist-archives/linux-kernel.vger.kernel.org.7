I think you mean moving all child LRU list to the parent memcg's =
inactive
list. It works well for your case. But sometimes, due to shared page =
cache
pages, some pages in the child list may be accessed more frequently than
those in the parent's. Still, it's okay as they can be promoted quickly
later. So I am fine with this change.

I noticed that, which is why I asked the second question. It's
inefficient when dealing with numerous pages related to a memory
cgroup.

I don't think there'll be an observable slowdown. I think objcg is
more effective for slab objects as they're more sensitive than user
pages. If it's acceptable for slab objects, it should be acceptable
for user pages too.

I didn't adopt this approach for two reasons then:

  1) It's inefficient to change `->memcg_data` to the parent when
     iterating through all pages associated with a memory cgroup.

  2) During iteration, we might come across pages isolated by other
     users. These pages aren't in any LRU list and will thus miss
     being reparented to the parent memory cgroup.

Muchun,
Thanks.
