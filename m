I forgot to mention: you used tabs, which breaks when tabstop is not set
to 8 (such as in my editor. This is how it looks for me ):

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------=
-
    Devres::drop() {      Devres::devres_callback() {
       self.data.revoke() {         this.data.revoke() {
          is_available.swap() =3D=3D true
                    is_available.swap =3D=3D false
                 }
              }
  =20
              // [...]
              // device fully unbound
          drop_in_place() {
             // release device resource
          }
       }
    }

I personally would have used spaces for this, but it looks fine in my
gitlog, so feel free to keep it this way.
