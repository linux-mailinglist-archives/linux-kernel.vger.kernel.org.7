The block sizes seem to be similar in principle to class sizes in
zsmalloc. It seems to me that there are two apparent differentiating
properties to zblock:

- Block lookup uses an rbtree, so it's faster than zsmalloc's list
  iteration. On the other hand, zsmalloc divides each class into
  fullness groups and tries to pack almost full groups first. Not sure
  if zblock's approach is strictly better.

- Zblock uses higher order allocations vs. zsmalloc always using order-0
  allocations. I think this may be the main advantage and I remember
  asking if zsmalloc can support this. Always using order-0 pages is
  more reliable but may not always be the best choice.

On the other hand, zblock is lacking in other regards. For example:
- The lack of compaction means that certain workloads will see a lot of
  fragmentation. It purely depends on the access patterns. We could end
  up with a lot of blocks each containing a single object and there is
  no way to recover AFAICT.

- Zblock will fail if a high order allocation cannot be satisfied, which
  is more likely to happen under memory pressure, and it's usually when
  zblock is needed in the first place.

- There's probably more, I didn't check too closely, and I am hoping
  that Minchan and Sergey will chime in here.

Zblock is performing better for this specific workload, but as I
mentioned earlier there are other aspects that zblock is missing.
Zsmalloc has seen a very large range of workloads of different types,
and we cannot just dismiss this.

Well, we should start by breaking down the differences and finding out
why zblock is performing better, as I mentioned above. If it's the
faster lookups or higher order allocations, we can work to support that
in zsmalloc. Similarly, if zsmalloc has unnecessary complexity it'd be
great to get rid of it rather than starting over.

Also, we don't have to do it all at once and invalidate the testing that
zsmalloc has seen. These can be incremental changes that get spread over
multiple releases, getting incremental exposure in the process.
