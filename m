Yes, there are many. But that is not what I meant by source of truth.

Currently, we are conflating two things
- whether the CPU has the LA57 capability
- whether the CPU is using the LA57 capability to support 5-level paging.

The CPU feature gets set too late to be useful, and then needs to be
cleared again if we happen to run with 4 levels of paging.

In my original patch, which is the one Ingo objected to,
pgtable_l5_enabled() is unambiguously based on whether CR4.LA57 is
set.

Not sure I follow you here.

Yes, this is needed because we conflate the CPU capability with
whether or not we are running with 5 levels of paging.

That code runs after __startup_64() so it should observe the correct
value. But it's flaky as hell, which is why I am trying to fix this.

I'd much rather get rid of those variables entirely, which is what I
proposed initially.

In the light of the above, care to comment on the previous approach?

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250504095230.2932860-28-ardb+git@google.com/

That also uses the ALTERNATIVE_TERNARY() so the CR4 access gets
patched away, and I'm happy to take suggestions how to improve that.
But it replaces those global variables with expressions that are
directly derived from CR4.LA57, which I think is likely the most
robust approach.

I'd still like to split off the LA57 CPU capability from the 5-level
paging state, but that needs careful consideration of the existing
users: for instance, KVM might need the capability in some cases, but
the current state in others. There is also some IOMMU driver code that
refers to the feature.
