Andy, thanks for the precise explanation of the problem :)

So it took me some time but here are my thoughts on this. We should 
treat pt_regs and thread_struct differently as they do not represent the 
same thing:
- pt_regs represents the context of a thread when it takes a trap
- thread_struct represents a "kernel-induced" (or a "in-kernel") context 
not caused by traps

That's why I don't really like Deepak's proposal below as it mixes both 
and I find it tricky.

I can't find a situation where saving/restoring the entire sstatus at 
context-switch is a problem though, does anyone have such thing in mind?

Finally I understand that having another copy of sstatus in 
thread_struct is not intuitive and we should, either explain why or only 
store the SUM bit (like for sstatus.VS).

Please continue the discussion as we need to find a solution that 
pleases everyone soon :)

Thanks all for jumping in,

Alex
