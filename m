I don't really see any possible security issues either with null seed.

It's no different as per remote attestation when compared storage keys.
In a power cycle it's like same as per TPM2_Certify is considered. It's
pretty much exactly performance issues but depending on deployment.
Sometimes storage key root would be probably a better choice.

I really tried to dig something else than exactly perf stuff but was
unsuccessful to find anything, and I've actually done a lot of work
at work on remote attestation so everything is also somewhat fresh
on my mind.

Still rooting to perf, immediate action being default option disable,
and long term action being replacing the compilation option with
kernel command-line options. I.e., I'll stay on track what I'e
been already doing for some time :-)

That said, my PR cover letter (or the tag message) did suck and
I'll just address next during exactly why something is or isn't
an issue. I think this is really good outcome for everyone in
the long run (because everyone will get the outcome they were
looking for).

BR, Jarkko
