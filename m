Slight correction: it's not the "hardware limits" line, but rather
"current policy".

Note that booting mainline u-boot in non-EFI mode (using plain Image)
doesn't change the results above.

FTR: I've tried to bluntly wrap rk3576_bl32_v1.05.bin into an ELF file
using the following linker script and feed it as $TEE to the mainline
u-boot build, but the resulting u-boot-rockchip.bin gets stuck at boot
after checking hashes of ATF images, so I'm still lost as to how one
can check if the OP-TEE has any influence on the cpufreq behavior.
