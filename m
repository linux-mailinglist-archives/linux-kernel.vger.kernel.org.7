The flags are needed for non-threaded IRQs too.

I think this can probably be split into:

"Add IRQ module"
"Add IRQ flags" <--- in preparation for next patch
"Add non-threaded IRQs"
"Add threaded IRQs=E2=80=9D

WDYT?

Yeah, in this instance that is true.=20

I think this is working as intended. The C bindgen function does take =
usize, so
the u64 can go away. I guess this confusion started because the =
individual
flags are u32 though, so at least a conversion from u32 to usize will be
needed.

Well, SpinLockIrq has been brewing for quite a while. Waiting for it to =
land
can introduce an unbounded delay here. Note that IRQ handling is =
extremely
important for drivers.

What we can do is to simply remove the locks from all the examples. The =
code
will still work fine, you just won't be able to mutate the data without =
the
interior mutability, of course.

A subsequent patch can (re)introduce the examples where the data is =
mutated
when SpinLockIrq lands. WDYT?

Ah yes, that would be very helpful. SpinLockIrq is another very =

missing piece in the ecosystem.
