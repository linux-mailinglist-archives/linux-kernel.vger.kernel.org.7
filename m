Ahh I see what you mean now; exit always emits barriers but only the last exit
clears TIF_LAZY_MMU.

I think that's much cleaner, but we are changing the API which needs changes to
all the arches and my attempt at [1] didn't really gain much enthusiasm.

My previous attempt was, in hindsight, hideous. It seems to be the case that
only arm64 suffers this problem so let's just fix it here.

Agreed, and thanks!
