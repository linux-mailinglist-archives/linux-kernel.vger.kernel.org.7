Yeah, but it has worked like that for a long time.

Is it opaque?  (I'd say it standard event rather than legacy event.)  I
think the mapping for the standard events are clearly defined.

Right, it's not consistent.  Maybe we need a different uniq event name
for extended (standard) events.  How about "cycles(cpu_core)"?  I guess
we don't want to add a space between the PMU and event names to avoid
potential user impact when they parse the output.
