We could also change the C side to use refcounting :) It is probably a
bigger change (I have no idea how common the usage of debugfs is).

In my mind, it would also allow the C side to benefit from the same
"drop the dirs that you don't need anymore and all subdirs will be
removed if they also aren't referenced any longer" thing.

I would prefer refcounting over forgetting, it much more clearly shows
who owns the debugfs dirs. Also, in which cases would one not call
`.keep()`? The USB example from the other thread comes to mind, but
there you might be able to borrow a `Dir<'static` for `'static`, are
there other cases?
