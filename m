Worth rerunning if possible, but I would guess that those benchmarks will still
show the similar improvement because they are measuring the cost of doing the
TLB flushing. But with the fix, there is an extra cost that those benchmarks
probably won't measure; subsequent work within the target mm will have no VAs
cached in the TLB so the miss rate will be much higher.

Ha, yes... infact it looks like that's what it did prior to commit db6c1f6f236d
("mm/tlbbatch: introduce arch_flush_tlb_batched_pending()").

I'll do that tidy up once this fix appears in mm-unstable.

Thanks,
