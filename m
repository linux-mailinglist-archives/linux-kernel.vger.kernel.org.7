I was asked to squash two specific commits. The first was making the
read method generic. That was the one that deleted much code. Totally
reasonable, and the generic stuff might be discarded anyway, so I won't
be moving stuff back and forth.

However, the second commit was the one introducing PropertyGuard. That
was a beautifully atomic commit, no circular dependencies in sight. If
this commit is to be split up, one of the smaller ones would without
doubt look exactly the same as the one before. I provided a link[1]
to the exact email telling me to squash that exact patch to avoid any
confusion.

The point is that I agree with you that the PropertyGuard patch can be
split out. And possibly more: I think a reasonable person could make a
separate commit for every `property_read_<type>` method. And I'm happy
to do that if it's the way to go.  But if I do that, send a v3 and then
someone else asks me to squash it again (because they didn't read this
exchange between you and me...) then I would've wasted my time.

I'm trying, but I can't say I have a good first impression of doing
code review over a mailing list. Doing open-heart surgery with a
pickfork and writing documents in Microsoft Word both seem like more
productive and enjoyable activities to me.
