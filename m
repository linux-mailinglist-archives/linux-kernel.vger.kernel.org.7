Surely the MIDR/REVIDR/AIDR also change?

In general, silent migration isn't acceptable for the kernel, even if
you largely happen to get away with that today. It is not acceptable for
architectural feature support to change dynamically.

Do these parts have EL2?

I don't think that's quite true, unless these parts are also violating
the architecture.

If the CPU doesn't implement AArch32, then an ERET to AArch32 is
illegal. The way illegal exception returns are handled means that this
will result in a (fatal) illegal execution state exception being taken
from the exception return code in the kernel, not an UNDEF being taken
from userspace that would result in a SIGILL.

I do not think that we should pretend to support hardware with silent
microarchitectural migration. So at the very least, we do not care about
A10/A10X/T2.

Mark.
