Technically, memory is always handed over to the GIC following a GICv5
MMIO register poll that guarantees the GIC has seen the change (whether
it is making an IST table valid, or enabling an ITS - that in turn means
device table (DT) translations are enabled).

One thing I could do is to make the readl_relaxed_poll_timeout_atomic()
readl_poll_timeout_atomic() on those "completion registers", which adds
the required barriers (I can add a comment to the related calling
sites).

That should also allow me to remove the dma_rmb() barrier that I need in:

gicv5_irs_iste_alloc()

to prevent the CPU from issuing a cache invalidation before the

readl_relaxed_poll_timeout_atomic()

loop has completed.

I don't see any other corner case where the _relaxed version would
not work I tried to follow other drivers where AFAICS the relaxed
version is used by default unless the non-relaxed one is strictly
needed (GICv3/SMMUv3).

I can obviously update the {irs/its}_ helpers to add a relaxed
name to make sure it is more obvious to understand what they do.

Would that work ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
