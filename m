multipath's libmpathpersist library. You contributed some code to it
IIRC. It predates the kernel interface, and even if we switched to using
the kernel interface to send persistent reservation commands to the
paths instead of doing that in userspace (the dm_pr_ops functions would
needs some reworking to handle multipath, where the rules are different
than for other dm-devices. For instance, you only want to reserve on one
path, and it's not necessarily a failure if you can't register a key
down all paths) we would still probably want to use the library, since
it also coordinates with multipathd so that it can register keys on
paths that are later added to the multipath device or were down when the
registration initially happened.

Libmpathpersist does register the same key for all paths of a multipath
device. Doing anything else would be crazy. Sorry if my last email was
misleading. But the kernel API cannot help in the case where a path is
later added to the multipath device, or was down when the initial
registration happened.

But again, all this is orthogonal to the patches in question, which have
nothing to do with Persistent Reservations.
