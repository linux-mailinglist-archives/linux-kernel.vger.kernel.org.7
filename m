OK. So basically, all this does, is a promise by driver to only
DMA into a range of memory?
This part, I get. I wouldn't put it in a capability, just in config
space then.

What I don't get, is what does the *device* want, exactly?

Here's a vague idea to explain the question:

some embedded devices can have addressing restrictions, such
as the number of bits of an address.
In another example, the legacy balloon device only supports addresses
up to 48 bit.
These can still be useful if driver does not use the inaccessible
addresses.



So far so good? Does this look like a generalization of your idea?


Now, a question: DMA API under linux at least, can actually work
around device limitations using a bounce buffer. It does, however,
need to know what to work around.
So, maybe the device needs to expose a range?
But what is the range in your case?
 

Maybe the new registers list the range of addresses device can access,
and driver promises to be within that range by negotiating the
feature bit?
