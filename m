It's not just about the fork performance, on some servers there could
be ~100K processes and ~200 CPUs, that will be hundreds of MBs of
memory just for the counters.

And nowadays it's not something uncommon for a desktop to have ~64
CPUs and ~10K processes.

If we use a single shared "per-cpu" counter (as in the patch), the
total consumption will always be only about just dozens of bytes.

It usually doesn't walk all CPUs, only the CPUs that actually used
that mm_struct, by checking mm_struct's cpu_bitmap. I didn't check if
all arch uses that bitmap though.

It's true that one CPU having its bit set on one mm_struct's
cpu_bitmap doesn't mean it updated the RSS counter so there will be
false positives, the false positive rate is low as schedulers don't
shuffle processes between processors randomly, and not every process
will be ran at a period.

Also per my observation the reader side is much colder compared to
updater for /proc.
