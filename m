I see, saying "any" was indeed too strong.

Of course this cannot be guaranteed. The function may always fail and
return DMA_MAPPING_ERROR. No doubts about it.

Some of these scenarios can never work properly because of hardware
limitations. There's nothing software can do about a bus master which
cannot address any RAM in the machine. I'm not trying to claim that an
operating system kernel can do magic and square the circle. If that's
how it sounded, then my wording needs to be improved.

IIUC the expected audience of this document are device driver authors.
They want a clear guidance on how they should allocate buffers for the
streaming DMA API. Now, it is my understanding that device drivers
should *not* have to care about the physical location of a buffer
passed to the streaming DMA API.

Even if a bus master implements less than 32 address bits in hardware,
I'm convinced that device drivers should not have to examine the system
to check if an IOMMU is available and try to guess whether a buffer
must be bounced, and how exactly the bounce buffer should be allocated.

If we can agree on this, I can iron out the details for a v2 of this
patch series.

I know this very well. As you may not be aware, my ultimate goal is to
get rid of ZONE_DMA and instead enhance the buddy allocator to allow
allocations within an arbitrary physical address range, which will not
rely on platform support. But that's another story; for now, let's just
agree on how the DMA API is supposed to work.
