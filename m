It is *only* in your (QCom) control. I would love to have control over
receiving patches to review, but sadly I do not.

Then you should mark them RFC at least if you know they are going into 6.18=
.

That's exactly what we expect. Companies following the rules or
preferences of the kernel community is exactly what is expected and
required. Companies that continuously fail to do that result in
requirements that all patches be first signed off by trusted kernel
developers in those companies.

What would you have done if the timing hit in the merge window where
you have trees which have policies of don't send new content during
merge windows? Just going to ignore that?

Patches should stand on their own. I'm talking about patches in other serie=
s.

Sorry, I'm not going to go read your product pages...
