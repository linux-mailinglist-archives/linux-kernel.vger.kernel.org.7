Yeah, I also don't have an idea, but if I find something, I'll let you
know.

Yeah that's true.

Hmm that is unfortunate. But I don't see a problem with having:

    static USB_DEBUGFS: Dir<'static> =3D ...; // or some on-demand init pro=
cess

Then users can store subdir that also is `Dir<'static>` and just borrow
the USB_DEBUGFS for `'static`.

The docs on `keep` should definitely warn about leaks.
