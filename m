Sorry, I replied only on github since that was easier to do more quickly. ;)

Yes I would recommend for now to keep the `UnsafeCell` in the kernel sources, 
until the compiler actually implements the change that removes `noalias` from 
`&UnsafePinned`. And even then you should probably keep the `UnsafeCell` when 
building for older compiler versions from before that patch (or keep it until 
you drop support for those older compiler versions).

This is not a spec-only change, codegen really has to be adjusted to make 
`&UnsafePinned` properly compatible with mutable aliasing, and I see no reason 
to risk potential problems here by prematurely removing that `UnsafeCell`.

Kind regards,
Ralf
