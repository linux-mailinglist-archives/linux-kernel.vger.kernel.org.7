-wm-FPU-emu is an FPU emulator for Linux. It is derived from wm-emu387
-which was my 80387 emulator for early versions of djgpp (gcc under
-msdos); wm-emu387 was in turn based upon emu387 which was written by
-DJ Delorie for djgpp.  The interface to the Linux kernel is based upon
-the original Linux math emulator by Linus Torvalds.
-
-My target FPU for wm-FPU-emu is that described in the Intel486
-Programmer's Reference Manual (1992 edition). Unfortunately, numerous
-facets of the functioning of the FPU are not well covered in the
-Reference Manual. The information in the manual has been supplemented
-with measurements on real 80486's. Unfortunately, it is simply not
-possible to be sure that all of the peculiarities of the 80486 have
-been discovered, so there is always likely to be obscure differences
-in the detailed behaviour of the emulator and a real 80486.
-
-wm-FPU-emu does not implement all of the behaviour of the 80486 FPU,
-but is very close.  See "Limitations" later in this file for a list of
-some differences.
-
-Please report bugs, etc to me at:
-       billm@melbpc.org.au
-or     b.metzenthen@medoto.unimelb.edu.au
-
-For more information on the emulator and on floating point topics, see
-my web pages, currently at  http://www.suburbia.net/~billm/
-
-
---Bill Metzenthen
-  December 1999
-
-
------------------------ Internals of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------
-
-Numeric algorithms:
-(1) Add, subtract, and multiply. Nothing remarkable in these.
-(2) Divide has been tuned to get reasonable performance. The algorithm
-    is not the obvious one which most people seem to use, but is designed
-    to take advantage of the characteristics of the 80386. I expect that
-    it has been invented many times before I discovered it, but I have not
-    seen it. It is based upon one of those ideas which one carries around
-    for years without ever bothering to check it out.
-(3) The sqrt function has been tuned to get good performance. It is based
-    upon Newton's classic method. Performance was improved by capitalizing
-    upon the properties of Newton's method, and the code is once again
-    structured taking account of the 80386 characteristics.
-(4) The trig, log, and exp functions are based in each case upon quasi-
-    "optimal" polynomial approximations. My definition of "optimal" was
-    based upon getting good accuracy with reasonable speed.
-(5) The argument reducing code for the trig function effectively uses
-    a value of pi which is accurate to more than 128 bits. As a consequence,
-    the reduced argument is accurate to more than 64 bits for arguments up
-    to a few pi, and accurate to more than 64 bits for most arguments,
-    even for arguments approaching 2^63. This is far superior to an
-    80486, which uses a value of pi which is accurate to 66 bits.
-
-The code of the emulator is complicated slightly by the need to
-account for a limited form of re-entrancy. Normally, the emulator will
-emulate each FPU instruction to completion without interruption.
-However, it may happen that when the emulator is accessing the user
-memory space, swapping may be needed. In this case the emulator may be
-temporarily suspended while disk i/o takes place. During this time
-another process may use the emulator, thereby perhaps changing static
-variables. The code which accesses user memory is confined to five
-files:
-    fpu_entry.c
-    reg_ld_str.c
-    load_store.c
-    get_address.c
-    errors.c
-As from version 1.12 of the emulator, no static variables are used
-(apart from those in the kernel's per-process tables). The emulator is
-therefore now fully re-entrant, rather than having just the restricted
-form of re-entrancy which is required by the Linux kernel.
-
------------------------ Limitations of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------
-
-There are a number of differences between the current wm-FPU-emu
-(version 2.01) and the 80486 FPU (apart from bugs).  The differences
-are fewer than those which applied to the 1.xx series of the emulator.
-Some of the more important differences are listed below:
-
-The Roundup flag does not have much meaning for the transcendental
-functions and its 80486 value with these functions is likely to differ
-from its emulator value.
-
-In a few rare cases the Underflow flag obtained with the emulator will
-be different from that obtained with an 80486. This occurs when the
-following conditions apply simultaneously:
-(a) the operands have a higher precision than the current setting of the
-    precision control (PC) flags.
-(b) the underflow exception is masked.
-(c) the magnitude of the exact result (before rounding) is less than 2^-16382.
-(d) the magnitude of the final result (after rounding) is exactly 2^-16382.
-(e) the magnitude of the exact result would be exactly 2^-16382 if the
-    operands were rounded to the current precision before the arithmetic
-    operation was performed.
-If all of these apply, the emulator will set the Underflow flag but a real
-80486 will not.
-
-NOTE: Certain formats of Extended Real are UNSUPPORTED. They are
-unsupported by the 80486. They are the Pseudo-NaNs, Pseudoinfinities,
-and Unnormals. None of these will be generated by an 80486 or by the
-emulator. Do not use them. The emulator treats them differently in
-detail from the way an 80486 does.
-
-Self modifying code can cause the emulator to fail. An example of such
-code is:
-          movl %esp,[%ebx]
-	  fld1
-The FPU instruction may be (usually will be) loaded into the pre-fetch
-queue of the CPU before the mov instruction is executed. If the
-destination of the 'movl' overlaps the FPU instruction then the bytes
-in the prefetch queue and memory will be inconsistent when the FPU
-instruction is executed. The emulator will be invoked but will not be
-able to find the instruction which caused the device-not-present
-exception. For this case, the emulator cannot emulate the behaviour of
-an 80486DX.
-
-Handling of the address size override prefix byte (0x67) has not been
-extensively tested yet. A major problem exists because using it in
-vm86 mode can cause a general protection fault. Address offsets
-greater than 0xffff appear to be illegal in vm86 mode but are quite
-acceptable (and work) in real mode. A small test program developed to
-check the addressing, and which runs successfully in real mode,
-crashes dosemu under Linux and also brings Windows down with a general
-protection fault message when run under the MS-DOS prompt of Windows
-3.1. (The program simply reads data from a valid address).
-
-The emulator supports 16-bit protected mode, with one difference from
-an 80486DX.  A 80486DX will allow some floating point instructions to
-write a few bytes below the lowest address of the stack.  The emulator
-will not allow this in 16-bit protected mode: no instructions are
-allowed to write outside the bounds set by the protection.
-
------------------------ Performance of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------
-
-Speed.
------
-
-The speed of floating point computation with the emulator will depend
-upon instruction mix. Relative performance is best for the instructions
-which require most computation. The simple instructions are adversely
-affected by the FPU instruction trap overhead.
-
-
-Timing: Some simple timing tests have been made on the emulator functions.
-The times include load/store instructions. All times are in microseconds
-measured on a 33MHz 386 with 64k cache. The Turbo C tests were under
-ms-dos, the next two columns are for emulators running with the djgpp
-ms-dos extender. The final column is for wm-FPU-emu in Linux 0.97,
-using libm4.0 (hard).

-The performance under Linux is improved by the use of look-ahead code.
-The following results show the improvement which is obtained under
-Linux due to the look-ahead code. Also given are the times for the
-original Linux emulator with the 4.1 'soft' lib.

-These figures are now somewhat out-of-date. The emulator has become
-progressively slower for most functions as more of the 80486 features
-have been implemented.
-
-
------------------------ Accuracy of wm-FPU-emu -----------------------
-
-
-The accuracy of the emulator is in almost all cases equal to or better
-than that of an Intel 80486 FPU.
-
-The results of the basic arithmetic functions (+,-,*,/), and fsqrt
-match those of an 80486 FPU. They are the best possible; the error for
-these never exceeds 1/2 an lsb. The fprem and fprem1 instructions
-return exact results; they have no error.
-
-
-The following table compares the emulator accuracy for the sqrt(),
-trig and log functions against the Turbo C "emulator". For this table,
-each function was tested at about 400 points. Ideal worst-case results
-would be 64 bits. The reduced Turbo C accuracy of cos() and tan() for
-arguments greater than pi/4 can be thought of as being related to the
-precision of the argument x; e.g. an argument of pi/2-(1e-10) which is
-accurate to 64 bits can result in a relative accuracy in cos() of
-about 64 + log2(cos(x)) = 31 bits.

-
-** The accuracy for exp() and log() is low because the FPU (emulator)
-does not compute them directly; two operations are required.
-
-
-The emulator passes the "paranoia" tests (compiled with gcc 2.3.3 or
-later) for 'float' variables (24 bit precision numbers) when precision
-control is set to 24, 53 or 64 bits, and for 'double' variables (53
-bit precision numbers) when precision control is set to 53 bits (a
-properly performing FPU cannot pass the 'paranoia' tests for 'double'
-variables when precision control is set to 64 bits).
-
-The code for reducing the argument for the trig functions (fsin, fcos,
-fptan and fsincos) has been improved and now effectively uses a value
-for pi which is accurate to more than 128 bits precision. As a
-consequence, the accuracy of these functions for large arguments has
-been dramatically improved (and is now very much better than an 80486
-FPU). There is also now no degradation of accuracy for fcos and fptan
-for operands close to pi/2. Measured results are (note that the
-definition of accuracy has changed slightly from that used for the
-above table):
-
-Function      Tested x range          Worst result
-                                     (absolute bits)
-
-cos(x)        0 .. 9.22e+18              62.0
-sin(x)        1e-16 .. 9.22e+18          62.1
-tan(x)        1e-16 .. 9.22e+18          61.8
-
-It is possible with some effort to find very large arguments which
-give much degraded precision. For example, the integer number
-           8227740058411162616.0
-is within about 10e-7 of a multiple of pi. To find the tan (for
-example) of this number to 64 bits precision it would be necessary to
-have a value of pi which had about 150 bits precision. The FPU
-emulator computes the result to about 42.6 bits precision (the correct
-result is about -9.739715e-8). On the other hand, an 80486 FPU returns
-0.01059, which in relative terms is hopelessly inaccurate.
-
-For arguments close to critical angles (which occur at multiples of
-pi/2) the emulator is more accurate than an 80486 FPU. For very large
-arguments, the emulator is far more accurate.
-
-
-Prior to version 1.20 of the emulator, the accuracy of the results for
-the transcendental functions (in their principal range) was not as
-good as the results from an 80486 FPU. From version 1.20, the accuracy
-has been considerably improved and these functions now give measured
-worst-case results which are better than the worst-case results given
-by an 80486 FPU.
-
-The following table gives the measured results for the emulator. The
-number of randomly selected arguments in each case is about half a
-million.  The group of three columns gives the frequency of the given
-accuracy in number of times per million, thus the second of these
-columns shows that an accuracy of between 63.80 and 63.89 bits was
-found at a rate of 133 times per one million measurements for fsin.
-The results show that the fsin, fcos and fptan instructions return
-results which are in error (i.e. less accurate than the best possible
-result (which is 64 bits)) for about one per cent of all arguments
-between -pi/2 and +pi/2.  The other instructions have a lower
-frequency of results which are in error.  The last two columns give
-the worst accuracy which was found (in bits) and the approximate value
-of the argument which produced it.

-Tests performed on an 80486 FPU showed results of lower accuracy. The
-following table gives the results which were obtained with an AMD
-486DX2/66 (other tests indicate that an Intel 486DX produces
-identical results).  The tests were basically the same as those used
-to measure the emulator (the values, being random, were in general not
-the same).  The total number of tests for each instruction are given
-at the end of the table, in case each about 100k tests were performed.
-Another line of figures at the end of the table shows that most of the
-instructions return results which are in error for more than 10
-percent of the arguments tested.
-
-The numbers in the body of the table give the approx number of times a
-result of the given accuracy in bits (given in the left-most column)
-was obtained per one million arguments. For three of the instructions,
-two columns of results are given: * The second column for f2xm1 gives
-the number cases where the results of the first column were for a
-positive argument, this shows that this instruction gives better
-results for positive arguments than it does for negative.  * In the
-cases of fcos and fptan, the first column gives the results when all
-cases where arguments greater than 1.5 were removed from the results
-given in the second column. Unlike the emulator, an 80486 FPU returns
-results of relatively poor accuracy for these instructions when the
-argument approaches pi/2. The table does not show those cases when the
-accuracy of the results were less than 62 bits, which occurs quite
-often for fsin and fptan when the argument approaches pi/2. This poor
-accuracy is discussed above in relation to the Turbo C "emulator", and
-the accuracy of the value of pi.
