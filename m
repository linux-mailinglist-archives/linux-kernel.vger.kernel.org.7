Oh, I see, it always try to allocate segments sequentially in a large
section-size image, thanks for your explanation. :)

static unsigned int __get_next_segno(struct f2fs_sb_info *sbi, int type)
{
...
	if (__is_large_section(sbi)) {
...
		return curseg->segno;
...
}

static int new_curseg(struct f2fs_sb_info *sbi, int type, bool new_sec)
{
...
	segno = __get_next_segno(sbi, type);
	ret = get_new_segment(sbi, &segno, new_sec, pinning);
...
}

BTW, I guess it could be more efficient if we can reuse free segment in
dirty section for conventional device.

So, for this case, we can handle it only in checkpoint.

Do we need to handle sbi->next_victim_seg[FG_GC] as well?
