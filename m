I replied only this patch in the series because, when I first started
programming using the Linux Coding Style in 2004, the single statement brace
rule was the only rule I disagreed with. And that was in part due to the fact
that, at three of my previous employers, the C coding style had dictated
mandatory use of braces. So the explicit prohibition of braces for single
statement conditionals really surprised me.

And note the rule, as written, is not what actually seems to be enforced (at
least by checkpatch.pl). What seems to be enforced is to not use braces where
the conditional is a single line and there is a single line statement. In
other words, if either the conditional or the single statement span multiple
lines, then braces are allowed (or encouraged?). As examples, checkpatch.pl
does not complain about any of the following (either to recommend adding
braces or removing braces):

	if (a_really_long_line_function_name(a_really_long_identifier) ||
	    another_really_long_function_name(another_long_identifier)) {
		braced();
	}

	if (a_really_long_line_function_name(a_really_long_identifier) ||
	    another_really_long_function_name(another_long_identifier))
		not_braced();

	if (a)
		call_a_really_long_function(with_long_argument,
					    another_log_argument);

	if (a) {
		call_a_really_long_function(with_long_argument,
					    another_log_argument);
	}

I'll also note that the popular style guide published by Michael Barr as well
as the MISRA C standard also dictate braces (but I'll admit that both of these
have other rules which contradict the Linux style and where I agree with the
Linux style).

All of that said, ultimately, the Coding Style is supposed to be enforce
consistent style that is readable and maintainable. I get that. I personally
believe that requiring braces makes the code more maintainable, and doesn't
detract from readability. However I'm also agree that changing the rule would
need to eventually lead to changing all the code that doesn't conform (since
one of the reasons for having a style is to have consistency), so I'm also
swayed by admonition to not "argue the specifics of the coding style without a
really really good reason why, with real details and proof," so I'll let
others have their say.
