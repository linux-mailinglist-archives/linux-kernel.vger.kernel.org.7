It was the main reason because all CPUs contended on xtime lock and
other global locks. The subsequent issues you describe were not
observable back then to the extent they are today for bloody obvious
reasons.

As I said above, the main reason was contention on xtime lock and some
other global locks. These contention issues had been resolved over time,
so the initial reason to have the skew was gone.

The power consumption issue was a valid reason to remove it and the
testing back then did not show any negative side effects.

The subsequently discovered issues, were not observable and some of them
got introduced by later code changes.

Obviously the patch is problematic in hindsight, but hindsight is always
20/20.

What are you trying to do here? Playing a blame game is not helping to
find a solution.

That's a _NEW_ problem and has nothing to do with the power saving
concerns which led to af5ab277ded0.

Guessing is not a valid engineering approach, as you might know already.

It's not rocket science to validate whether these power saving concerns
still apply and to reach out to people who have been involved in this
and ask them to revalidate. I just Cc'ed Arjan for you.

> How can we address this issue in a better way then?

By analysing the consequences of flipping the default for skew_tick to
default on, which can be evaluated upfront trivially without a single
line of code change by adding 'skew_tick=1' to the kernel command line
and running tests and asking others to help evaluating.

There is only a limited range of scenarios, which need to be looked at:

      - Big servers and the power saving issues on lightly loaded
        machines

      - Battery operated devices

      - Virtualization (guests)

That might not cover 100% of the use cases, but should be a good enough
coverage to base an informed decision on.

The kernel should not do a lot of things, but does them due to
historical decisions, which turn out to be suboptimal when technology
advances. The power spike problem simply did not exist 18 years ago at
least not to the extent that it mattered or caused concerns.

If we could have predicted the future and the consequences of ad hoc
decisions, we wouldn't have had a BKL, which took only 20 years of
effort to get rid of (except for the well hidden leftovers in tty).

But what we learned from the past is to avoid hacky ad hoc workarounds,
which are guaranteed to just make the situation worse.

Thanks,
