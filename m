I have same observations on my end.

While adding this delay fixes the detect issue, it could lead to other
problems.
Detect hook is called every 10 sec and considering that, 400ms is a
considerable amount of time. And it could cause performance issues like
frame drops and glitches in display.

For 1920x1080@60fps resolution, when I run weston application, I see
around ~24 frames being dropped every 10 sec with visual glitch in
display. This seems consistent with 400ms delay for 60fps or 16.67ms per
frame (24*16.67ms).

I have seen such link training failures occasionally when the
display connector is not connected but the state is not reflected
correctly.
Maybe it could be attributed to long polling duration???
Are you observing it even on re-runs?
