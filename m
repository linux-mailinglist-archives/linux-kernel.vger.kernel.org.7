So, DRM kind of has support for it, but not really.

What you're trying to do is essentially what i915 fastboot is about:
booting flicker-free, and speeding up the probe process.

i915 does so using two things:

  * IIRC, the UEFI exposes its splashscreen through ACPI, and this in
    turn is exposed through sysfs. Plymouth then picks it up, and does
    its own thing with it. I think it would be fairly easy to do
    something similar for simple-drm: the memory is typically reserved,
    so it will stick around, and you just need to expose the memory
    buffer as a sysfs file. If we want to make it simpler, I guess we
    could expose it as BMP, and that would possibly require a format
    conversion. But yeah, it shouldn't be too hard.

  * Then, the i915 driver has a custom reset hook. reset() is about
    building the initial state, and most drivers actually go from a
    pristine state. However, nothing prevents a driver from building a
    custom initial state by building it from the register. Then, you'll
    only get a flicker if the compositor initial modeset actually
    requires a modeset. Otherwise, you can just do a page flip.

We discussed it with Sima in the past, and here's a more detailed
description of what it would entail:
