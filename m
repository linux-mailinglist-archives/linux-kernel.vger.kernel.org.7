I hate to be obnoxious, but your email kind of exemplifies why I, and
I think many developers, REALLY dislike the TXT and related specs.
It's full of magic words that mean nothing to anyone not immersed in
this particular ecosystem.

What is the "setup kernel"?  Do you mean the early code in the kernel?

Are you saying that all of these items are measured by the early
loader (and *not* measured by the ACM or otherwise by anything that is
trustworthy and runs before the early code)?

Here is my concern:

Suppose there is a set of measurements that an attacker wants to
replicate.  Some of these measurements are done prior to transferring
control to the early code that's in this patchset (call these
before-Linux measurements) and some are done by the loaded kernel
(let's call these Linux measurements).

I am concerned that the attacker will load a combination of things
that have the correct before-Linux measurements but the wrong
after-Linux measurements.  (Wrong in the sense that, *if those
measurements actually landed in the PCRs, then the attacker would
lose*.)  *But* the attacker carefully chooses what they're loading to
gain control of the system prior to the actual PCR extension.  Then
the attacker extends the PCR with the hash that they want to
replicate, and the attacker wins.

For the security model to make any sense at all, then it needs to be
impossible for the attacker to gain control prior to the early kernel
code running without changing the before-Linux measurements.  But
there is a huge gap between when the early Linux code runs and when
the late initcalls run, and the attacker has that entire window to
break your security.

I'm arguing that it seems like that this patchset has a
runtime-integrity problem.  It's outside the scope of the TXT spec per
se.  It's in the scope of *the Linux kernel*, and anyone who wants to
trust that the Linux DRTM code actually works needs to factor in this
giant weakness.

And you haven't explained why there is no way for an attacker to
corrupt the process between the early kernel code and the late
measurement code.

Hey TPM maintainers, I think this is nonsense, or maybe someone has
misinterpreted something that someone else said.  I understand that
avoiding code duplication is nice.  I understand that, at runtime, all
TPM access ought to go through the driver.  But, if the driver is
incapable of working during the very very early kernel load, then
there should be an alternate interface.  Kind of like how we have
early_printk instead of saying "well, there should only be one printk,
so instead of having early_printk, we'll just have a big buffer of
messages and log them eventually".  Or kind of like how we might call
EFI boot service functions during early boot.
