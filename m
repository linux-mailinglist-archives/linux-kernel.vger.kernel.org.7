It would make `RawDeviceRegistration` simpler, but maybe it's not worth
it.

So what I write below it not really true. But the argument relies on the
fact that `data` is pointing to a value that will stay alive for the
duration of the existence of `self`. That should be a safety requirement
of `new` (even if we take a reference as an argument).

Then keep the longer names.

Ah then I'll re-read that discussion.

Yes the reference is still valid in the `new` function call. I was under
the impression that the pointer created in `new` would get invalidated,
because the struct would get reborrowed in the meantime, but that's not
the case, since this pointer is obtained by `get`. So you should be
good.

I think we don't need a comment here.

That's not exactly how I would think about it, but your argument makes
sense.

That's great :)

Yeah that is true. Ultimately for this case it won't matter, since I'll
just implement the access thing in pin-init.

It'll still take a while, because it will touch several parts that other
patches also touch. Thus I prefer to first pick the patches already on
the list, but for that I'll wait until the merge window closes.
