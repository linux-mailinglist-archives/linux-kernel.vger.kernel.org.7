The usual cause is use of an rcu_torture_ops function pointer without
having first checked that it is non-NULL.  But I suspect that you already
checked for this.

I am carrying it in -rcu, but marked "EXP" so that I don't post it or
send it along in a pull request.

I just now started a short test with it reverted.

Oh, and yours and Boqun's latest passed overnight tests except for a
few Kconfig issues including the PREEMPT_RT pair:

75cf58ef310a ("Merge branches 'rcu/misc-for-6.16', 'rcu/seq-counters-for-6.16' and 'rcu/torture-for-6.16' into rcu/for-next")

This is a known Kconfig issue in torture.sh, fixed by this -rcu commit:

2e26af16b7b6 ("torture.sh: Force CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y for --do-rt configurations")

There are also Kconfig issues with a few of the KCSAN rcutorture scenarios
that I am looking into.  And torture.sh needs to be more aggressive about
reporting these...
