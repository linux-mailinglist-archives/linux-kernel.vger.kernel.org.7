Not really.  The commit message is saying just a theoretical and unlikely
possibility.

I don't have a way to demonstrate it.  The commit message was only for
discussing a theoretical and unlikely case.  Maybe it was better to just not
mention.

You're correct.

Sorry for the poor cover letter message.  If I have to post a new version of
this patch series, I would update the cover letter message as below.  Does it
look better?  If so, could you please update the cover letter part of the
commit on the mm tree?

"""
DAMON is initialized in subsystem initialization time, by damon_init().  If
DAMON API functions are called before the initialization, the system could
crash.  Actually such issues happened and were fixed [1] in the past.  For the
fix, DAMON API callers have updated to check if DAMON is initialized or not,
using their own hacks.  The hacks are unnecessarily duplicated on every DAMON
API callers and therefore it would be difficult to reliably maintain in the
long term.

Make it reliable and easy to maintain.  For this, implement a new DAMON core
layer API function that returns if DAMON is successfully initialized.  If it
returns true, it means DAMON API functions are safe to be used.  After the
introduction of the new API, update DAMON API callers to use the new function
instead of their own hacks.

As always, please let me know if there is anything I can help.


Thanks,
