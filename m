How? This patch does one thing: it adds request_irq functionality.

I dislike this notation. It is just a magnet for conflicts.

The C code takes in ffi::c_ulong. Shouldn=E2=80=99t this map to u64? Or =

This is not upstream yet. I removed all mentions of SpinLockIrq on
purpose, but I apparently missed some as you say.

We definitely need interrupt-aware spinlocks to access the data in =
interrupt
context. It is just a matter of deciding whether we will be referring to =
a type
whose API is not 100% formalized as we speak, or to SpinLock itself - =
which is
already upstream - with a caveat. I chose the latter.

Right, I actually rendered the docs before submitting, but apparently I =
missed this.

>=20

It's a reminder, inherited from the C side, that literally as soon as
request_irq() returns, your handler may be called. Anything that you =
need to
setup before your handler can run must already have been done by this =
point.

Is this the =E2=80=9Csecond sentence=E2=80=9D you are referring to?

This is taken straight from the C docs. As I told Andreas, I=E2=80=99d =
prefer if we
didn=E2=80=99t add our own docs for C things that have their own docs =

Yes, that is the point of SpinLockIrq. The exact syntax is still up for =
debate,
although by this time I think Lyude & Boqun have already settled on =
something.
