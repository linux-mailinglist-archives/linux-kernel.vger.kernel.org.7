No, sorry, but debugfs files are "create and forget" type of things.
The caller has NO reference back to the file at all in the C version,
let's not add that functionality back to the rust side after I spent a
long time removing it from the C code :)

If you really want to delete a debugfs file that you have created in the
past, then look it up and delete it with the call that is present for
that.

The only thing I think that might be worth "keeping" in some form, as an
object reference as discussed, is a debugfs directory.
