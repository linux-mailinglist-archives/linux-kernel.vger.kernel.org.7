I read the code again and concluded the change above is not related to
locking and would be a separate issue: when we close a Sysfs session,
we need to disable a config on a CoreSight device.

Could you clarify what is meaning "unloadable moudle for active_cnt"?
I only saw "cscfg_mgr->sys_active_cnt" is used for module unloading,
but have no clue why "active_cnt" impacts module unloading.

Thanks for pointing out this.  I read the code and understood that in
some scenarios the list is protected by the mutex "cscfg_mutex".

I would argue for using locking, we need to make clear for two thigns:

- What is the race condition;
- What locking is used to protect the race condition.

For current case, a CoreSight device has a config list, the race
condition is the config list will be manipulated by multiple places
(e.g., for module loading / unloading, opening or closing a perf or
SysFS session).  So a spinlock is used to to protect the config list.

"cscfg_mutex" is a high level lock, my understanding is to protect the
high level operations from the Sysfs knobs, though sometimes it can
mitigate the race condition on configuration list mentioned above, but
the spinlock is the locking mechanism for the low level's config list
on a CoreSight device.

Mixed using cscfg_mutex and spinlock get code complexity, and I am a bit
concerned this is not best practice.

At a glance, I would say 'cscfg_mutex' is purposed to protect the global
'cscfg_mgr', per CoreSight device's config list should be protected by
'cscfg_csdev_lock'.

I looked at cscfg_load_feat_csdev(), it uses 'cscfg_csdev_lock' to
protect the feature list.  This is why I thought the feature list also
need to be protected by the lock.  Now it is only partially protected.

To make things more clear, I have a questions.

'cscfg_mgr->sys_active_cnt' is used in the cscfg_unload_config_sets()
function to decide if can unload module, if any configuration is
active, why this variable cannot prevent unloading module?

Sorry for late replying.
