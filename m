I'd implement the Send method, or just say that the method is to be
implemented in future when it will be needed.

OK. Can you also mention it? And if we'll need to share bitmaps
between C and Rust modules, are you going to create a new class, or
extent the existing one?

No. set_bit(), clear_bit() and test_bit() don't know the bitmap size
and can't check out-of-boundary. 

But your Rust set_bit() does! You can check boundaries unconditionally,
and throw errors depending on the hardening config. If user wants to set
an out-of-boundary bit, you should just do nothing,

The hardening should be disabled for benchmarking reasons, isn't?
