I think I get what you mean. RGB are directly related to the power of
each of the primary emitters in a display. YUV OTOH carries the overall
luma and the difference from neutral (chroma) signals. This difference
is the difference between color models.

Monochromatic is not the right word here, unless you explicitly refer
to the primaries of BT.2020 which are laser-like. Most display
primaries are far from monochromatic. The closer to monochromatic
display primaries get, the more pronounced the differences between
color vision in people become, even if the people were all classified
as having normal color vision.
