OK. I've outlined why I disagree, but it sounds like consensus here is that=
:
1. You want a `File<T>` that implements `Deref` to expose a `&T`.
2. To enable `T` to take on values which are not `ForeignOwnable`, you
want me to make `create_file` return a `PinInit<File<T>>` (We will
also grow a `T: Sized` bound here.)

You are aware that:
1. A `File` can no longer be placed in a normal Rust collection, you
will either need to box it or use a special collection kind.
2. Adding or removing DebugFS support for some data in a driver may
cause more noise (code edits non-local to the debug logic) than
expected.

The one thing I still don't see a consensus on:

What do you want me to do about standard traits for `File`? If we're
intending it to be heavily used throughout structs, we'll effectively
break `#[derive]` if I don't add support. For example, if we had
```
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct FooAttrs {
  name: String,
  size: usize,
}
// In my current patch world someone adds `File`, it's by putting
`FooAttrs` into an `Arc` and passing that into `create_file`, no
modifications to the structure are made.
```
before, we have an obvious semantics for this. If someone adds `File`
with the new API, we get
```
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
#[pin_data]
struct FooAttrs {
  #[pin]
  name: File<String>,
  #[pin]
  size: File<usize>,
}
```

This means that for the `#[derive]` to keep working, `File` needs to
implement these traits. Do we want it to:
A. Purely delegate, so making this sort of change keeps the same
behavior of derived traits
B. Do what makes sense for a `File`, so e.g. Debug might print 'File {
data: "name_of_foo" }', and PartialEq might test for equality of the
dentry if not an error

I'm guessing you want A, but I've been through so many API reworks at
this point that I wanted to ask in case there's  disagreement here.
