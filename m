Dear Valentin,

Indeed, as you mentioned, delaying the throttle time does not affect the execution
of high-priority tasks when they want to run.

I should actually mark this as an RFC PATCH.
On one hand, it allows others using the rt-linux system who are troubled by issues
related to cgroup locking and limits to temporarily bypass these problems with my
patch.
On the other hand, I look forward experts may review the patch to see if there are
any serious or obvious issues that I may have overlooked, or if there are areas
for further improvement.

Dear Sebastian,

I am currently carefully reviewing the existing patches and applying them to our
current project version of rt-linux 6.1.134 to see if I can reproduce the previously
encountered issues. I will provide feedback on any problems as soon as possible.


Thanks
