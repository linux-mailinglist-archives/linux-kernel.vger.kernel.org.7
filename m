If we willing to place hacks like that, better to bold it:

If we're willing to do that, I would prefer to place "_noprof" into an array, 
as we may have other similar cases. Also, please comment why we need it and
where we have those "_noprof". We tent to forget why rules are added. As the
code churns, we may end dropping things without updating kernel-doc.

---

for a more long term solution, maybe one option for cases like that would
be to have something like:

/**
  * foo(), foo_noprof() - common function description (is it possible to have 
  *      a single description for both - as they're semantically different?)
  * @_size: size description
  * @_flags: flags description
  *
  * some description, including an explanation what are the differences
  * between both
  */
#define foo(_size, _flags)                    foo_node(_size, _flags, NUMA_NO_NODE)
#define foo_noprof(_size, _flags)             foo_node_noprof(_size, _flags, NUMA_NO_NODE)

Still, another kernel-doc markup will be needed for foo_node variants, as 
the parameters are different anyway.

Please notice that this is easier said than done as the above may break the
kernel-doc's sequential state machine at the parser if not done with care,
specially since one might eventually modify the arguments on just one of
the variants, like:

#define foo(_size, _flags, _bar)              foo_node(_size, _flags, bar, NUMA_NO_NODE)
#define foo_noprof(_size, _flags)             foo_node_noprof(_size, _flags, NUMA_NO_NODE)
	
Btw, we do have things like that: there are several register 
functions/macros that have THIS_MODULE on one of their variants,
like this:

	#define acpi_bus_register_driver(drv) \
	        __acpi_bus_register_driver(drv, THIS_MODULE)

I didn't find yet a good way to have a single kernel-doc markup
that would fill both cases and won't add too much complexity on
both kernel-doc syntax and at the kernel-doc code.

At the above, we probably don't want to document the __foo
variant, as all kAPI calls should use the variant that doesn't
have THIS_MODULE, but there are other similar cases where the
__foo variant, for instance, don't have some mutex or semaphore,
and we may still want both documented.


Thanks,
Mauro
