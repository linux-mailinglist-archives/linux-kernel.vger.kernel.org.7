That's a fair point. I don't expect this code to be fully final, another
thing that isn't really optimal (as mentioned in the comment message) is
that we're not probing paths in parallel, potentially adding up timeouts
from multiple paths.

I don't think this is a problem of the interface, though, but we can
improve the implementation keeping the same interface.

Maybe I'm missing something, but I think the reason why it has to be
uninterruptible is just that submit_bio_wait() has the completion on the
stack? So I suppose we could just kmalloc() some state, submit all the
bios, let the completion callback free it, and then we can just stop
waiting early (i.e. wait_for_completion_interruptible/killable) and let
the requests complete on their own in the background.

Would this address your concerns or is there another part to it?

Ben already fixed up the missing check.

Not attempting PG failover was also his suggestion, on the basis that it
would be additional work for no real benefit when you can only submit
requests for the current PG anyway. If userspace retries the SG_IO, it
will already pick a different PG, so having the kernel do the same
doesn't really improve anything.

Maybe I misunderstood, but my understanding from the feedback you got
back then was that no SCSI-specific code was wanted in device mapper.
This is why we kept interpreting the status codes in userspace.

While discussing the approaches with Mikuláš and Ben, one option that
was briefly discussed was a pair of ioctls: One that wraps ioctls and
returns which path the ioctl took, and another one to fail that path if
inspection of the result in userspace comes to the conclusion that it's
a path error. I didn't think this could be implemented without also
allowing an unprivileged process to DoS the device by just failing all
paths even if they are still good, so we didn't continue there.

Anyway, if it actually were acceptable for the kernel to check SG_IO
results for path errors and fail the path while still returning the
result unchanged, then that would work for us for the specific case, of
course. But I don't expect this really addresses Christoph's concerns.
If you think it does, is there another reason why you didn't try this
before?

(And it wouldn't be generic, so would we potentially have to repeat the
exercise for other ioctls in the future?)

Yes, it's a bit unfortunate, but we have to work with what we have. QEMU
doesn't even necessarily know that it's dealing with a multipath device,
so it just has to blindly try the ioctl and see if it works.
