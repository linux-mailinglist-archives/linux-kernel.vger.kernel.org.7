You've not responded to a ton of comments, I'm guesing I should assume in
those cases you're acking the comments implicitly? :) Do let me know.

Yeah it makes sense to combine those two, but maybe there's a better way of
splitting things out.

Right, misread that! :) sorry. I guess then in fact there is no such thing
as an order-1 mTHP? I did wonder how useful that'd be so makes more sense

That really sucks. Do please put this context in a comment though (see
below for more discussion on this).

What I'm saying is - what is this expressed in? There's no information on
that here.

So from what you say I can see it's the number of bits required in the
bitmap, because we're being smart and only bothering to mark entries at a
granularity of minimum mTHP size.

OK so the idea is this is the number of PTE entries per entry in the
bitmap.

This is KEY missing context. We really need to spell things out here, the
THP code is... confusing :) to put it politely, so we need to be especially
careful to be mega clear.

So please please PLEASE add a comment explaining all this. And clearly
state that the unit here is bits.

Again missing context is you're storing bits per minimum mTHP as per above.

OK, this context is fantastic + important for understanding, so let's put
it in a comment :)

OK sorry, based on David's feedback on this - just use 1UL << xxx here instead.

(An aside that isn't really relevant now but - also I was wrong to suggest
_BITUL() anyway BIT() is The Way (TM), for some reason I had it in my head
that the former was better :P)

Yeah again, this is the missing context that would have helped me feel a

Yup again this is due to the missing context above.

Saying 'scratch pad' is really just saying 'temporary' using different
words :) this isn't hugely helpful.

If we _need_ this we should give this a better name, and I also don't know
why we need this on the stack for all collapse_control users. Can't you
just have your 'scratch pad' local to the function that needs it or passed
as a pointer?

I'm sure it'd be useful to somebody to stick various temporary things in
vm_area_struct for instance, but it'd be hugely egregious to do so...

You're putting a LOT of data on the stack, and kernel stacks are very
delicate, I'm quite concerned about this.

BEFORE:

struct collapse_control {
	bool                       is_khugepaged;        /*     0     1 */

	/* XXX 3 bytes hole, try to pack */

	u32                        node_load[64];        /*     4   256 */

	/* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

	/* --- cacheline 4 boundary (256 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
	nodemask_t                 alloc_nmask;          /*   264     8 */

	/* size: 272, cachelines: 5, members: 3 */
	/* sum members: 265, holes: 2, sum holes: 7 */
	/* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};

272 bytes.

AFTER:

struct collapse_control {
	bool                       is_khugepaged;        /*     0     1 */

	/* XXX 3 bytes hole, try to pack */

	u32                        node_load[64];        /*     4   256 */

	/* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

	/* --- cacheline 4 boundary (256 bytes) was 8 bytes ago --- */
	nodemask_t                 alloc_nmask;          /*   264     8 */
	long unsigned int          mthp_bitmap[2];       /*   272    16 */
	long unsigned int          mthp_bitmap_temp[2];  /*   288    16 */
	struct scan_bit_state      mthp_bitmap_stack[128]; /*   304   512 */

	/* size: 816, cachelines: 13, members: 6 */
	/* sum members: 809, holes: 2, sum holes: 7 */
	/* last cacheline: 48 bytes */
};

816 bytes.

So you're roughly tripling the size of this struct and making this a thing
in all callstacks that reference collapse_control.

Kernel stack is a _super_ finite resource.

I mean I can't really review your stack implementation thing until you've
added a comment to help me understand what you are doing there (sorry but
it's just too fiddly for me to first principles it), but I wonder if we
truly need to be doing this?

I wonder if we can just put this into somewhere allocated...

A reason as to why this is the case would be helpful :)

No, we absolutely cannot leave _address as '_address', that's terrible and
I'm just not going to live with that.

I know it's trivial, but it's just such a horrid naming convention.

Can we just change that when we need it?

'Future proofing' for an possible future implementation detail is just not
how we should implement things.

Right now we don't do that, so let's just pass the order. If in future we
want to change it we can.

You're missing some of the comments, I'm guesing for most of the smaller

You've not responded to this suggestion re: refactoring here.

I'm really not a fan of us arbitrarily messing with rmap locks like this,
and we should very carefully keep track of whether we have/have not
released them.

Again rmap locking is a dangerous area, I've got personal experience of
this (see top of mm/rmap.c for an indication of complexity here as well as
https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/mm/process_addrs.html).

We're going to need more than this to be confident, you need to clearly
justify why we won't encounter issues this way.

Unfortunately this is a _totally_ unacceptable justification. We can't put
in barriers based on 'better safe than sorry'. You need to analysis this
and determine whether or not it's necessary.

So the comment in pmd_install() seems to give an indication:

	if (likely(pmd_none(*pmd))) {	/* Has another populated it ? */
		mm_inc_nr_ptes(mm);
		/*
		 * Ensure all pte setup (eg. pte page lock and page clearing) are
		 * visible before the pte is made visible to other CPUs by being
		 * put into page tables.
		 *
		 * The other side of the story is the pointer chasing in the page
		 * table walking code (when walking the page table without locking;
		 * ie. most of the time). Fortunately, these data accesses consist
		 * of a chain of data-dependent loads, meaning most CPUs (alpha
		 * being the notable exception) will already guarantee loads are
		 * seen in-order. See the alpha page table accessors for the
		 * smp_rmb() barriers in page table walking code.
		 */
		smp_wmb(); /* Could be smp_wmb__xxx(before|after)_spin_lock */
		pmd_populate(mm, pmd, *pte);
		*pte = NULL;
	}

Yup this was before I realised it was an iterative implementation :)

It's code that's very horrible to understand using a very unusual way of
initialising a struct within the kernel.

And having code be understandable when the compiler can inline for us does
indeed justify this even in the instance of 4 lines and one caller :)

OK thanks.

Right, to reiterate - this needs a _big_ comment.

I'm sorry to split the review of this patch in two on this, because once
you do that I'm going to inevitably do the deferred review on the
algorithm, but I just feel this is the only sensible way I can determine
whether what you intend to do here makes sense and is correctly
implemented.

Kinda need that 'what you intend to do' bit. So it should be an expansive
and detailed comment explicitly explaining the algorithm and why you're
doing it.

Thanks!

Yeah, I'm not hugely convinced :) responded there.

I can probably give more useful feedback on this once the big comment is
added!

Again you've skipped a ton of review comments here. You need to respond to
everything.
