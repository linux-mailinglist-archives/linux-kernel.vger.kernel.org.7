Indeed.  And we have two of these classes here.  :)

To be fair, one letter is enough if you're used to the name.  Everything
of the form s*printf() people know that the differentiating part is that
single letter between 's' and 'p', and a quick look at the function
prototype usually explains the rest.

More than that, and it's unnecessarily noisy to my taste.  But not
everyone does string work all the time, so I get why you'd be less prone
to liking the name.

I won't press for the name.  Unless you say anything, my next revision
of the series will call it sprintf_end().

In this case, I wouldn't want to go that way and reuse the name
snprintf(3), because the kernel implementation of snprintf(3) is
non-conforming, and both the standard and the kernel snprintf() have
semantics that are importantly different than this API in terms of
handling errors.

I think reusing the name with slightly different semantics would be
prone to bugs.

Anyway, sprintf_end() should be clear enough that I don't expect much
bikeshedding for the name.  Feel free to revisit this in the future and
merge names if you don't like it; I won't complain.  :)


Have a lovely night!
Alex
