I agree, and this is my current plan for the next version of this patch.

I agree all the points.  Especially the current interface is ambiguous and easy
to mistake.

Yes, this would be the ideal.  But, memorizing something in page level is ...
always an interesting challenge in my opinion, and I have no good idea to do
this for now :)

Agreed, I don't need to rush.  Let's take time and discuss sufficiently. :)

Nonetheless, I may post a followup version of this patch series that contains
this one, even before we get a conclusion about this specific one.  I think I
may have to do that, for sharing the future idea in a way easy to understand
and test.  I think it might also help us at understanding the real ROI of this
patch, and if there is another option to move forward.  In the case, I will of
course keep RFC tag and clearly note that this patch is still under the
discussion and not willing to be merged as is before the discussion is done.

I mean, I can't help when CONFIG_DAMON is enabled.

The race (or, handling faults that caused by other entity) can hppen if and
only if all below things happen.

1. CONFIG_DAMON is enbled.
2. CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING is enabled.
3. The user repeatedly turns on and off NUMA balancing and fault-based mode
   DAMON in runtime.

If any of these are not true, the race can completely avoided.  I was saying
about the case that the first condition is not met.

I completely understand your concerns, thank you for nicely and patiently
keeping this discussion.  I don't need to upstream this in short term, and open
to every option.  So let's take sufficient time and discussions.

I will take more time to think about a few potential options to move forward,
and share those with a level of details that can help us easily further
discuss, hopefully in a few days.


Thanks,
SJ
