Thanks a lot for the state machine diagram.

Strictly speaking, sched_in() can keep INACTIVE state if an event is
rotated.

A detailed transition is:

  Case 1: {ACTIVE} -> {INACTIVE} -> {OFF,EXIT,REVOKED,DEAD}
  Case 2: {ERROR} -> {ERROR,EXIT,REVOKED,DEAD}
  Case 3: {OFF} -> {OFF,EXIT,REVOKED,DEAD}

Just a minor concern.

I noticed perf_put_aux_event() sets the ERROR state for sibling events
of an AUX event. IIUC, the AUX event is the group leader, so we only
need to clean up the cgroup pointer for the AUX event, and simply set
the ERROR state for its sibling events, correct?

Except above concern, otherwise, the conclusion makes sense to me.

Totally agree. The comment would be very useful!
