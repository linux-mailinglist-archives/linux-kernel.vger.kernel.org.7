So using the clocksource-switch test in kselftest, I can pretty easily
hit inconsistencies with this.

The reason is since we use the coarse_nsec as the nanosecond portion
of the coarse clockids, I don't think we ever want to set it to zero,
as whenever we do so, we lose the previous contents and cause the
coarse time to jump back.

It seems more likely that we'd want to do something similar to
tk_update_coarse_nsecs() filling it in with the shifted down
tk->tkr_mono.xtime_nsec.

Thinking more on this, I get that you're providing the offset to save
the "at the point" time into the coarse value, but I think this ends
up complicating things.

Instead it seems like we should just do:
  tk->coarse_nsec =3D tk->tkr_mono.xtime_nsec >> tk->tkr_mono.shift;

However, we would need to skip doing the update if we didn't
accumulate anything. This would perserve the coarse clockid only
updating on tick interval boundaries and avoid the potential negative
correction to the xtime_nsec when we do the frequency adjustment.

I've got a patch in testing that is avoiding the inconsistency so far.
I'll try to send it out tomorrow.

thanks
