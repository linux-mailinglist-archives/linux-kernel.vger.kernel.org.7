It was the arch code that called resctrl_exit() - there is no other path into it.
I don't think its a problem for the arch code to also know to return an error.
I haven't found anything where which error is returned actually matter - so there
is no 'direction', only errors.

I agree the documentation can be improved.

Yup, that is necessary to stop the limbo and overflow workers for trying to read the
counters - which is a waste of time.

Makes sense - the alternative would be to dig around to cancel the limbo/overflow
work, and a subsequent CPU-online might start them again.

I agree.

Great - I'd missed that one,

It's not, the driver keeps track of whether resctrl_init() had been called, and only calls
resctrl_exit() once. But I agree it would be better to make it robust to this.
