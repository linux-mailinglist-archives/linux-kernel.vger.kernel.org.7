This is far too reductive, local vs global is only a minor detail as part
of a couple proposed solutions to a much larger topic. There are much more
fundamental issues around add-on boards to be worked out before we get to
this level of detail.

It defines an overlay with just special names in `__symbols__`, which is used along with an overlay for the addon-board, which makes use of the node names defined in the connector `__symbols__` overlay. Please take a look at the original patch series since it provides a working example of how it can be used [3].

However, for this discussion thread, I want to consolidate the discussion regarding how this approach directly adds the devices to the appropriate nodes, Eg. An SPI device in addon board will be added to the appropriate SPI controller, etc. This means the changes are made to the global tree.

This is how devices are already added, if you add a SPI device you
put it under the SPI controller. There is no "global tree", there
is just one device tree to represent the device, and it has a well
established ways of hierarchically representing devices.

This node takes precedence over global `__symbols__`, and thus is used to define standard names for nodes used in addon board overlay. Please look at [4] to get a more in-depth explanation.

Eg: an I2C device in addon board will be added to the connector node (as defined in i2c bus extension patch series [6]). This means the changes are made to the connector node and not the global tree.

This is the more fundamental issue: do you want to work within the existing
device tree framework, or do you want to make something new. `export-symbols`
is only the tip of the iceberg of new things that will be needed.

This "extra plumbing" is bus extensions in DT for every wired bus type.
Countless new Nexus nodes, connector definitions, pinmuxing, and bindings
for the same. And then changes to DT overlay tooling including all the
infrastructure that uses overlays in many external projects, which IMHO is
the largest issue here.

My core point here is this, imagine you take a BeagleBone and plug in
a cape. This statically combined device in your hand can be completely
described using existing DT today. For any solution we come up with for
doing this dynamically, the resulting DT should look the same as if
it was done for the combined device by hand ahead of time. The combined
Beagle+cape device is exactly the same device no matter what time you
plug in the cape. So why should the DT that describes this combined
device be different in the two cases?

I'm going to suggest we ignore the removal part. Not because it is too
difficult to solve, but because it is impossible to solve.

A huge amount of drivers and devices do not actually allow for removal.

The reason is because there is no need, hot-pluggable busses are the
exception, not the rule. The rare cases like USB are built to handle
this both in hardware and software. None of the connectors we have
talked about are actually hot-pluggable! I2C, SPI, etc.. none of
these are hot-pluggable. Even if you get away with yanking the cape
off a BeagleBone while it is running once or twice, it is violating
the electrical specifications and you will eventually break something.

If we don't focus on the (non-valid) removal part, so many other parts
solutions become viable again. Right now we have no good way to even
*add* an add-on board, even statically, so let's not let "perfect" be
the enemy of good..

> 
> A lot of connectors + addon board setups do not have any dynamic discovery addition. This is compounded when talking about treating the whole header in SBCs like PocketBeagle 2 as a connector, since people would want to wire LEDs and stuff to individual pins. So a mechanism using sysfs or configfs is required

I don't follow here. Multiple of the same I2C device are still identifiable
even on the same controller. Their IDs give them away, and even if not, this
would be trivially solved with a little bit of meta-data tracking in the
driver model layer.

How does the connector solution help here? Seems the `__symbols__` way would make
it easier to detect as both devices would need added to the same controller node,
which would be the point to detect such conflicts. Were each connector would have
no way to communicate that the resource is double-booked.

Easy to solve for either method, we can always re-run the device registration loop
after applying an overlay if it doesn't already.

There is one big benefit of evil vendor trees: you can test things out like
this before sending things upstream. You are working with the Beagle folks,
and that has to be the most perfect testing ground for add-on board overlay
solutions.

So I would suggest you take the solution you like the most and implement it
in the Beagle ecosystem. Try it out and find the pros and cons first hand,
see if it can even work in the first place.

Asking everyone to all reach a consensus on the "right" solution by
talking it out is not going to happen here. This has been an open issue
for way too long for it to be that easy :)
