Yes that's my point; once we have BBML3 it will be detected locally for each CPU
because the framework can handle that for MMFR fields. But until we get there,
we are stuck with a midr list.

OK, I don't understand the framework well enough to fully understand your
suggestion; I'll talk to Suzuki and have a dig through the code.

Thanks for the review!
