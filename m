This series adds the support for Assignable Bandwidth Monitoring Counters
(ABMC). It is also called QoS RMID Pinning feature

Series is written such that it is easier to support other assignable
features supported from different vendors.

The feature details are documented in the  APM listed below [1].
[1] AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming
Publication # 24593 Revision 3.41 section 19.3.3.3 Assignable Bandwidth
Monitoring (ABMC). The documentation is available at
Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206537

The patches are based on top of commit
92a09c47464d0 (tag: v6.15-rc5, tip/irq/merge) Linux 6.15-rc5
plus 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250515165855.31452-1-james.morse@arm.com/

It is very clear these patches will go after James's resctrl FS/ARCH
restructure. Hoping to avoid one review cycle due to the merge.

# Introduction

Users can create as many monitor groups as RMIDs supported by the hardware.
However, bandwidth monitoring feature on AMD system only guarantees that
RMIDs currently assigned to a processor will be tracked by hardware.
The counters of any other RMIDs which are no longer being tracked will be
reset to zero. The MBM event counters return "Unavailable" for the RMIDs
that are not tracked by hardware. So, there can be only limited number of
groups that can give guaranteed monitoring numbers. With ever changing
configurations there is no way to definitely know which of these groups
are being tracked for certain point of time. Users do not have the option
to monitor a group or set of groups for certain period of time without
worrying about counter being reset in between.
    
The ABMC feature provides an option to the user to assign a hardware
counter to an RMID, event pair and monitor the bandwidth as long as it is
assigned.  The assigned RMID will be tracked by the hardware until the user
unassigns it manually. There is no need to worry about counters being reset
during this period. Additionally, the user can specify a bitmask identifying
the specific bandwidth types from the given source to track with the counter.

Without ABMC enabled, monitoring will work in current 'default' mode without
assignment option.

# History

Earlier implementation of ABMC had dependancy on BMEC (Bandwidth Monitoring
Event Configuration). Peter had concerns with that implementation because
it may be not be compatible with ARM's MPAM.

Here are the threads discussing the concerns and new interface to address the concerns.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCg97cLVVAcacnarp+880xjsedEWGJPXhYpy4P7=ky4MZw@mail.gmail.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCiii0vXOF06mfV=kVLBzhfNo0SFqt4kQGwGSGVUqvr2Dg@mail.gmail.com/

Here are the finalized requirements based on the discussion:

*   Remove BMEC dependency on the ABMC feature.

*   Eliminate global assignment listing. The interface
    /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_control is no longer required.

*   Create the configuration directories at /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/.
    The configuration file names should be free-form, allowing users to create them as needed.

*   Perform assignment listing at the group level by introducing mbm_L3_assignments
    in each monitoring group. The listing should provide the following details:

    Event Configuration: Specifies the event configuration applied. This will be crucial
    when "mkdir" on event configuration is added in the future, leading to the creation
    of mon_data/mon_l3_*/<event configuration>.

    Domains: Identifies the domains where the configuration is applied, supporting multi-domain setups.

    Assignment Type: Indicates whether the assignment is Exclusive (e or d), Shared (s), or Unassigned (_).

*   Provide option to enable or disable auto assignment when new group is created.

This series tries to address all the requirements listed above.

# Implementation details

Create a generic interface aimed to support user space assignment of scarce
counters used for monitoring. First usage of interface is by ABMC with option
to expand usage to "soft-ABMC" and MPAM counters in future.

Feature adds following interface files:

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode: Reports the list of assignable
monitoring features supported. The enclosed brackets indicate which
feature is enabled.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs: Reports the number of monitoring
counters available for assignment.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/available_mbm_cntrs: Reports the number of monitoring
counters free in each domain.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs : Directory to hold the counter configuration.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter : Default configuration
for MBM total events.

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter : Default configuration
for MBM local events.

/sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments: Interface to list or modify assignment states on each group.

# Examples

a. Check if ABMC support is available
	#mount -t resctrl resctrl /sys/fs/resctrl/

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	[mbm_cntr_assign]
	default

	ABMC feature is detected and it is enabled.

b. Check how many ABMC counters are available. 

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs 
	32

c. Check how many ABMC counters are available in each domain.

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/available_mbm_cntrs 
	0=30;1=30

d. Check default counter configuration.

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter 
	local_reads, remote_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, remote_non_temporal_writes,
        local_reads_slow_memory, remote_reads_slow_memory, dirty_victim_writes_all

	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter 
	local_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, local_reads_slow_memory

e. Series adds a new interface file "mbm_L3_assignments" in each monitoring group
   to list and modify any group's monitoring states.

	The list is displayed in the following format:

        <Event configuration>:<Domain id>=<Assignment type>

        Event configuration: A valid event configuration listed in the
        /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs directory.

        Domain ID: A valid domain ID number.

        Assignment types:

        _ : No event configuration assigned

        e : Event configuration assigned in exclusive mode

	To list the default group states:
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To unassign the configuration of mbm_total_bytes on domain 0:
	#echo "mbm_total_bytes:0=_" > mbm_L3_assignments
	#cat mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=_;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To unassign the mbm_total_bytes configuration on all domains:
    	$echo "mbm_total_bytes:*=_" > mbm_L3_assignments
	$cat mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=_;1=_
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

	To assign the mbm_total_bytes configuration on all domains in exclusive mode:
    	$echo "mbm_total_bytes:*=e" > mbm_L3_assignments
	$cat mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

g. Read the events mbm_total_bytes and mbm_local_bytes of the default group.
   There is no change in reading the events with ABMC. If the event is unassigned
   when reading, then the read will come back as "Unassigned".
	
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
	779247936
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_local_bytes 
	765207488
	
h. Check the default event configurations.

	#cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_total_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads, remote_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, remote_non_temporal_writes,
	local_reads_slow_memory, remote_reads_slow_memory, dirty_victim_writes_all

	#cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, local_reads_slow_memory

i. Change the event configuration for mbm_local_bytes.

	#echo "local_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, local_reads_slow_memory, remote_reads" >
	/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter

	#cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/counter_configs/mbm_local_bytes/event_filter
	local_reads, local_non_temporal_writes, local_reads_slow_memory, remote_reads
	
        This will update the assignments where mbm_local_bytes are configured.
	
j. Now read the total event again. The first read may come back with "Unavailable"
   status. The subsequent read of mbm_total_bytes will display only the read events.
	
	#cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
	Unavailable
	#cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_00/mbm_total_bytes
	314101

k. Users will have the option to go back to 'default' mbm_assign_mode if required.
   This can be done using the following command. Note that switching the
   mbm_assign_mode will reset all the MBM counters of all resctrl groups.

	# echo "default" > /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode
	mbm_cntr_assign
	[default]
	
l. Unmount the resctrl
	 
	#umount /sys/fs/resctrl/

v13:
   Removed BMEC related 2 patches which were in the previous series.
   It was related to optimization which can be doen later.

   Patches are created on top of FS/ARCH restructure. So, major changes
   are due to FS/ARCH restructure. The files are split between
   arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/ and fs/resctrl/. So, functions
   are moved between these files accordingly.

   Added fflag RFTYPE_RES_CACHE for mbm_assign_mode, num_mbm_cntrs, available_mbm_cntrs.

   Removed the references to "mbm_assign_control".
  
   Moved resctrl_arch_config_cntr() prototype to include/linux/resctrl.h.
   Changed resctrl_arch_config_cntr() to retun void from int to simplify few call
   sequences.

   Added the event configuration details inside the evt_list in monitor domains.
   The avoids the need for new structure mbm_assign_config. 

   Passed evtid to functions resctrl_alloc_config_cntr() and resctrl_assign_cntr_event().
   Event configuration value can be easily obtained from mon_evt list.

   Added new patch to pass the entire struct rdtgroup to __mon_event_count(),
   mbm_update(), and related functions. We can easily get RMID,CLOSID etc from rdtgroup.

   Added new function __cntr_id_read_phys() to handle ABMC event reading.

   Added a new patch to hide BMEC related files when mbm_cntr_assign mode is enabled..
  
   Added the call resctrl_init_evt_configuration() to setup the event configuration during init.

   And few other commit message updates and user doc updates.

   be passing the event configuration from /info/L3_MON/event_configs/.

   Changed the check in resctrl_alloc_config_cntr() to reduce the indentation.
   Fixed the handling error on first failure while assigning.
   Added new parameter event configuration (evt_cfg) to get the event configuration from user space.

   Added tte support for reading ABMC counters. This is bit involved change and affects lots of code.

   New patch to support event configurations via new counter_configs method.

   Fixed the static check warning with initializing dom_id in resctrl_process_flags()

   Added change log in each patch for specific changes.

v10:
   Major change is related to domain specific assignment.
   Added struct mbm_cntr_cfg inside mon domains. This will handle
   the domain specific assignments as discussed in below.
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CALPaoCj+zWq1vkHVbXYP0znJbe6Ke3PXPWjtri5AFgD9cQDCUg@mail.gmail.com/
   I did not see the need to add cntr_id in mbm_state structure. Not used in the code.
   Following patches take care of these changes.
   Patch 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18.
   
   Added __init attribute to cache_alloc_hsw_probe(). Followed function

   Call mbm_cntr_reset() when unmounted to clear all the assignments.
   
   Fixed the issue with finding the domain in multiple iterations in rdtgroup_process_flags().
   
   Printed full error message with domain information when assign fails.
   
   Taken care of other text comments in all the patches. Patch specific changes are in each patch.
   
   If I missed something please point me and it is not intentional.

v9:
   Patch 14 is a new addition. 
   Major change in patch 24.
   Moved the fix patch to address __init attribute to begining of the series.
   Fixed all the call sequences. Added additional Fixed tags.

   Added Reviewed-by where applicable.

   Took care of couple of minor merge conflicts with latest code.

   Changed rdtgroup_assign_cntrs() and rdtgroup_unassign_cntrs() to return void.
   Updated couple of rdtgroup_unassign_cntrs() calls properly.

   Fixed problem changing the mode to mbm_cntr_assign mode when it is
   not supported. Added extra checks to detect if systems supports it.
   
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/03b278b5-6c15-4d09-9ab7-3317e84a409e@intel.com/
   As discussed in the above comment, introduced resctrl_mon_event_config_set to
   handle IPI. But sending another IPI inside IPI causes problem. Kernel
   reports SMP warning. So, introduced resctrl_arch_update_cntr() to send the
   command directly.

   Fixed handling special case '//0=' and '//".
   Removed extra strstr() call in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write().
   Added generic failure text when assignment operation fails.
   Corrected user documentation format texts.

v8:
  Patches are getting into final stages. 
  Couple of changes Patch 8, Patch 19 and Patch 23.
  Most of the other changes are related to rename and text message updates.

  Details are in each patch. Here is the summary.

  Renamed resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_configure to
            resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_set_one.

  Used the same IPI as event update to modify the assignment.
  Could not do the way we discussed in the thread.
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f77737ac-d3f6-3e4b-3565-564f79c86ca8@amd.com/
  Needed to figure out event type to update the configuration.

  Moved unassign first and assign during the assign modification.
  Assign none "_" takes priority. Cannot be mixed with other flags.
  Updated the documentation and .rst file format. htmldoc looks ok.

v7:
   Major changes are related to FS and arch codes separation.
   Changed few interface names based on feedback.
   Here are the summary and each patch contains changes specific the patch.

   Removed WARN_ON for num_mbm_cntrs. Decided to dynamically allocate the bitmap.
   WARN_ON is not required anymore.
 
   Renamed the function resctrl_arch_get_abmc_enabled() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_enabled().

   Merged resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable, resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable
   and renamed to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_set(). Passed the struct rdt_resource
   to these functions.

   Removed resctrl_arch_reset_rmid_all() from arch code. This will be done from FS the caller.

   Updated the descriptions/commit log in resctrl.rst to generic text. Removed ABMC references.
   Renamed mbm_mode to mbm_assign_mode.
   Renamed mbm_control to  mbm_assign_control.
   Introduced mutex lock in rdtgroup_mbm_mode_show().
 
   The 'legacy' mode is called 'default' mode. 

   Removed the static allocation and now allocating bitmap mbm_cntr_free_map dynamically.

   Merged rdtgroup_assign_cntr(), rdtgroup_alloc_cntr() into one.
   Merged rdtgroup_unassign_cntr(), rdtgroup_free_cntr() into one.
   
  Added struct rdt_resource to the interface functions resctrl_arch_assign_cntr ()
  and resctrl_arch_unassign_cntr().
  Rename rdtgroup_abmc_cfg() to resctrl_abmc_config_one_amd().
   
  Added a new patch to fix counter assignment on event config changes.

  Removed the references of ABMC from user interfaces.

  Simplified the parsing (strsep(&token, "//") in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write().
  Added mutex lock in rdtgroup_mbm_assign_control_write() while processing.

  Thomas Gleixner asked us to update  https://gitlab.com/x86-cpuid.org/x86-cpuid-db. 
  It needs internal approval. We are working on it.

v6:
  We still need to finalize few interface details on mbm_assign_mode and mbm_assign_control
  in case of ABMC and Soft-ABMC. We can continue the discussion with this series.

  Added support for domain-id '*' to update all the domains at once.
  Fixed assign interface to allocate the counter if counter is
  not assigned.   
  Fixed unassign interface to free the counter if the counter is not
  assigned in any of the domains.

  Renamed abmc_capable to mbm_cntr_assignable.

  Renamed abmc_enabled to mbm_cntr_assign_enabled.
  Used msr_set_bit and msr_clear_bit for msr updates.
  Renamed resctrl_arch_abmc_enable() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_enable().
  Renamed resctrl_arch_abmc_disable() to resctrl_arch_mbm_cntr_assign_disable().

  Changed the display name from num_cntrs to num_mbm_cntrs.

  Removed the variable mbm_cntrs_free_map_len. This is not required.
  Removed the call mbm_cntrs_init() in arch code. This needs to be done at higher level.
  Used DECLARE_BITMAP to initialize mbm_cntrs_free_map.
  Removed unused config value definitions.

  Introduced mbm_cntr_map to track counters at domain level. With this
  we dont need to send MSR read to read the counter configuration.

  Separated all the counter id management to upper level in FS code.

  Added checks to detect "Unassigned" before reading the RMID.

  More details in each patch.

v5:
  Rebase changes (because of SNC support)

  Interface changes.
   /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign to /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_mode.
   /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_control to /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_assign_control.

  Added few arch specific routines.
  resctrl_arch_get_abmc_enabled.
  resctrl_arch_abmc_enable.
  resctrl_arch_abmc_disable.

  Few renames
   num_cntrs_free_map -> mbm_cntrs_free_map
   num_cntrs_init -> mbm_cntrs_init
   arch_domain_mbm_evt_config -> resctrl_arch_mbm_evt_config

  Introduced resctrl_arch_event_config_get and
    resctrl_arch_event_config_set() to update event configuration.

  Removed mon_state field mongroup. Added MON_CNTR_UNSET to initialize counters.

  Renamed ctr_id to cntr_id for the hardware counter.
 
  Report "Unassigned" in case the user attempts to read the events without assigning the counter.
  
  ABMC is enabled during the boot up. Can be enabled or disabled later.

  Fixed opcode and flags combination.
    '=_" is valid.
    "-_" amd "+_" is not valid.

 Added all the comments as far as I know. If I missed something, it is not intentional.

v4: 
  Main change is domain specific event assignment.
  Kept the ABMC feature as a default.
  Dynamcic switching between ABMC and mbm_legacy is still allowed.
  We are still not clear about mount option.
  Moved the monitoring related data in resctrl_mon structure from rdt_resource.
  Fixed the display of legacy and ABMC mode.
  Used bimap APIs when possible.
  Removed event configuration read from MSRs. We can use the
  internal saved data.(patch 12)
  Added more comments about L3_QOS_ABMC_CFG MSR.
  Added IPIs to read the assignment status for each domain (patch 18 and 19)
  More details in each patch.

v3:
   This series adds the support for global assignment mode discussed in
   the thread. https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20231201005720.235639-1-babu.moger@amd.com/
   Removed the individual assignment mode and included the global assignment interface.
   Added following interface files.
   a. /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign
      Used for displaying the current assignment mode and switch between
      ABMC and legacy mode.
   b. /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_control
      Used for lising the groups assignment mode and modify the assignment states.
   c. Most of the changes are related to the new interface.
   d. Addressed the comments from Reinette, James and Peter.
   e. Hope I have addressed most of the major feedbacks discussed. If I missed
      something then it is not intentional. Please feel free to comment.
   f. Sending this as an RFC as per Reinette's comment. So, this is still open
      for discussion.

v2:
   a. Major change is the way ABMC is enabled. Earlier, user needed to remount
      with -o abmc to enable ABMC feature. Removed that option now.
      Now users can enable ABMC by "$echo 1 to /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_enable".
     
   b. Added new word 21 to x86/cpufeatures.h.

   c. Display unsupported if user attempts to read the events when ABMC is enabled
      and event is not assigned.

   d. Display monitor_state as "Unsupported" when ABMC is disabled.
  
   e. Text updates and rebase to latest tip tree (as of Jan 18).
 
   f. This series is still work in progress. I am yet to hear from ARM developers.
