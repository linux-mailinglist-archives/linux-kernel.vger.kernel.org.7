It's not as much about the exec path, as it is about making all the
non-exec paths (like shrinker/residency) have to deal with two
completely different things..

But I think I have figured out something workable.  I add an extra
refcnt per BO for the vma, incremented by userspace holding a gem
handle, userspace holding a dma-buf fd, or (ofc) actual pin for
scanout.  When the refcount is above zero I defer teardown in the
kms->vm until it drops to zero.  It isn't _exactly_ the same as lazy
VMA teardown when the BO is freed, but it is effectively the same
thing.  And whenever the vma_ref is greater than zero, the BO has
something else holding a ref so the ref loop doesn't matter.  If there
is no userspace process holding a reference to the BO via handle or
dma-buf fd, then it isn't going to be used again in a swapchain, so
the difference btwn tearing down the VMA when the vma_ref drops to
zero vs when the BO is freed doesn't amount to anything.

It's a bit weird adding some extra mechanism specifically for the
scanout vm, and maybe a bit uglier (depending on eye-of-beholder) than
making gpuvm work in either way (since the latter was a pretty
straightforward patch), but less ugly than having to parallel
mechanisms.  So if you _really_ don't like the WEAK_REF flag, I have a
workable alternative that addresses the performance problems.
