Indeed, much like we advertise contiguous sizes for hugetlb on the CPU, 
having them in the pgsize_bitmap gives a clue to IOMMU API users that 
there is some potential benefit in trying to align to these sizes where 
appropriate (e.g. __iommu_dma_alloc_pages()).

Secondly, there also needs to be a straightforward way for drivers to 
opt out of (or perhaps explicitly in to) this - IIRC there are some SMMU 
errata which have so far not mattered due to Linux not using the 
contiguous bit, for which the least painful workaround is probably for 
affected hardware to just continue not using the contiguous bit.

Thanks,
Robin.
