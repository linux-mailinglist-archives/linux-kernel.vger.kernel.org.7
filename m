Will do.

Let me think. The safety requirements here talk about safety of
implementing the trait.  But if you have a `Self` which is not wrapped, you
still cannot create an `Owned<Self>` in safe code. It's different from an
`AlwaysRefCounted`, where an `ARef<Self>` can be created from a `&Self`.

So, hmm, I think one could even move this safety requirement to `Owned::fro=
m_raw()`.

Together with the above, this would leave to safety requirements for `Ownab=
le.
Make `Ownable` a safe trait, then? Instead of safety requirements just add =
an invariant:

    # Invariant
   =20
    An `Owned<Self>` represents a unique reference to a `Self`, thus holdin=
g
    an `Owned<Self>` or `&mut Owned<Self>` allows one to assume that the ob=
ject
    is not accessed concurrently from elsewhere.

Not sure what is best. Would that make sense?

That's okay with me.
