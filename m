https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250610191600.54994-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/ fixed the
HKDF failure.  It was caused by a patch that changed initcall levels.

That's expected if you have CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_ARM64_CE_BLK enabled but
CONFIG_CRYPTO_XCTR disabled.  Some tests are skipped in that case.

That means the Rockchip crypto driver is broken.

It may have been broken for a long time.  Hardly anyone ever tests the hardware
crypto drivers, as they only work on very specific platforms and are often
useless anyway.  The software crypto is much better tested and often faster.

I don't think broken drivers like these should even be in the kernel at all.

For now, you should just disable CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_ROCKCHIP.

Anyway, the more interesting part of your email is that you pointed out that
Debian has the crypto self-tests enabled, precisely in order to automatically
disable buggy drivers like these.

And actually Fedora does this too.

This seems kind of crazy.  But unfortunately, the crypto/ philosophy seems to be
to enable as many untested and buggy drivers as possible, then rely on them
being (incompletely) self-tested in production.  So, aparently this is a thing.

But of course the distros won't want to enable the full set of tests, which
would slow down boot times significantly, but rather only the "fast" ones (as
they were doing before)...

So I'll send a patch that adds back a kconfig knob to run the fast tests only,
which I had removed in commit 698de822780f.
