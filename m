There is just no swap device in A. A still (31-40).

That would require each cgroup to hold a reference count of A.
So A can't be re-assign while having a cgroup using A. in 5.

I consider the user reassigning the same tier name with different
ranges is a user error. They want to shoot themself in the foot, we
can't stop them. Maybe we shouldn't even try to stop them. It does not
make sense to complicate things just to prevent users from doing
nonsense things. It has no additional complexity cost, sure.

If there is a life cycle of the invalidation? Forever does not seem to
be good either. It will prevent user reuse the tier range even there
is no cgroup referencing that before.

If you want this kind of invalidation, I suggest just make a reference
count on the "A", each cgroup that references "A" holds a reference
count. It will be tricky to reference count the default on case
though, basically every tier is reference counted.

Right.

+ means override default to "on" for all, allow every tier. (starting
for every tier)
- means override default to "off" for all. disallow every tier.
(starting from zero)

It is a knob to override all. Yes it is a special tier wild cast. If
the tier was not mentioned using +tier_name or -tier_name, the tier
uses the default on/off value. If a tier has more than one on/off
operation, the last write wins (closer to the leaf node cgroup) wins.

Therefore, if the cgroup has default override was set, there is no
need to lookup the parent any more, it overrides every tier already.
That provides a way for the child cgroup to overwrite all parent swap
tiers selection.

It is more flexible and I have a simple way to perform the parent
lookup on/off evaluation with short cuts. I send that out in the other
email.

More documents is better. Yes it diverges from the existing V2
convention as the parent contains the child. QoS is a policy, it is
relative indpendent of parents, unlike the containing relationship.

Then we will need to assign a fixed default range for them thus might
make this more complex when people actually define their own tiers.
I think the kernel should avoid making any default scheme on the user
space swap tiers. Just like the software that manages the cgroup
controls it.

There are other complications. e.g. I have priority 3: first SSD drive
1, then priority 2: HDD, then priority 1: SSD driver 2.
Pre-configured SSD tier will not be able to describe this, the first
and third drive in the list is SSD. It create conflict in ordering. I
think it is best to avoid defining any customer definable tier.

I see. the '-' you mean the '-' between two tiers. The leading '-'

It is the wild cast tier that controls on/off  for tier names that
haven't been mentioned with "+/-" "on/off" operation.
e.g.:
"- +ssd -hdd", that means default is off, turn on ssd and turn off hdd
(don't need to say that, default is already off).
But if there is also a zswap tier, it is not in the on/off operation
list. It is default to off because the leading "-".

In that case you want refcount the tiers by cgroup that reference it.
I am open to suggestion, I haven't give this too deep thought.
