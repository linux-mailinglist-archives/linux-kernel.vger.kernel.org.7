You can do both, especially if it turns out you won't be able to have
persistent variables on these machines.

That's for the Qualcomm maintainers, and the rest of us, to catch during
review. And people putting random values into devicetrees is
unfortunately not limited to SDAM addresses.

Furthermore, getting an allocated block of addresses in SDAM for Linux
could be useful for other things too.

Does it have to roll back? Can't you just keep it running after whatever
semi-random date it started at? And there is ntp and services like
fake-hwclock which saves the time on shutdown too.

Anyway, I still do no understand why you seem so reluctant to having a
proper functioning RTC using an SDAM offset.
