On x86, it is mostly the EFI variable services that user space has
come to rely on, not only for setting the boot path (which typically
happens only once at installation time, when the path to GRUB is set
as the first boot option). Unfortunately, the systemd folks have taken
a liking to this feature too, and have started storing things in
there.

There is also PRM, which is much worse, as it permits devices in the
ACPI namespace to call firmware routines that are mapped privileged in
the OS address space in the same way. I objected to this at the time,
and asked for a facility where we could at least mark such code as
unprivileged (and run it as such) but this was ignored, as Intel and
MS had already sealed the deal and put this into production. This is
much worse than typical EFI routines, as the PRM code is ODM/OEM code
rather than something that comes from the upstream EFI implementation.
It is basically a dumping ground for code that used to run in SMM
because it was too ugly to run anywhere else. </rant>

It would be nice if we could

a) Get rid of SetVirtualAddressMap(), which is another insane hack
that should never have been supported on 64-bit systems. On arm64, we
no longer call it unless there is a specific need for it (some Ampere
Altra systems with buggy firmware will crash otherwise). On x86,
though, it might be tricky because there so much buggy firmware.
Perhaps we should phase it out by checking for the UEFI version, so
that future systems will avoid it. This would mean, however, that EFI
code remains in the low user address space, which may not be what you
want (unless we do c) perhaps?)

b) Run EFI runtime calls in a sandbox VM - there was a PoC implemented
for arm64 a couple of years ago, but it was very intrusive and the ARM
intern in question went on to do more satisyfing work.

c) Unmap the kernel KPTI style while the runtime calls are in
progress? This should be rather straight-forward, although it might
not help a lot as the code in question still runs privileged.
