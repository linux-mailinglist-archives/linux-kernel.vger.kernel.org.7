I guess it's easier to reason about than a single, negated property but
the result should be identical. With two properties we can easily
implement the idreg override like nobbml2 since this works on the
sanitised ID regs. But we could also implement this differently, no need
to rely on the ID regs.

Stepping back a bit, we know that the MIDR allow-list implies
BBML2_NOABORT (and at least BBML2 as in the ID regs). In theory, we need
something like a SYSTEM_FEATURE which is the conjunction of all the
early CPUs. However, such system-level cap is only checked after all the
early CPUs booted _and_ only on the sanitised ID regs rather than MIDR.

We need a LOCAL_CPU feature behaviour to be called on each CPU but still
have the conjunction of early CPUs, more like the system one. It should
be permitted for late CPUs to have but not optional if already enabled.

So how about we introduce a WEAK_BOOT_CPU_FEATURE which gets enabled by
the boot CPU if it has it _but_ cleared by any secondary early CPU if it
doesn't (and never enabled by secondary CPUs). When the features are
finalised, we know if all early CPUs had it. In combination with
PERMITTED_FOR_LATE_CPU, we'd reject late CPUs that don't have it.

I think if we can get the above, it would be the cleaner option than
trying to bend our minds around double negations like !NO_BBLM2_NOABORT.
