Thanks for writing this up and sorry to disappoint you but this
explanation is giving me more reasons that memcg is not the right place
for these stats.

If you take a look at the memcg stats exposed through memory.stat, there
are two generally two types. First are the ones that describe the type
or property of the underlying memory and that memory is associated or
charged to the memcg e.g. anon or file or kernel (and other types)
memory. Please note that this memory lifetime can be independent from
the process that might have allocated them.

Second are the events that are faced by the processes in that
memcg like page faults, reclaim etc.

The ksm stats are about the process and not about the memcg of the
process. Process jumping from one memcg to another will take all these
stats with it. You can easily get ksm stats in userspace by traversing
/proc/pids/ksm_stats with the pids from cgroup.procs. You are just
looking for an easier way to get such stats instead of manual traversal.
I would suggest exploring cgroup iter based bpf program which can do
the stats collect and expose to userspace for a given cgroup hierarchy.
