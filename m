Cool, I had tunnel vision due working with entity->fence_context a lot 
and this just had misfortune to re-use the same name.

Would you do it in code or just in docs? I don't see a real benefit to 
it to be honest, since nothing depends on anything apart that it is a 
fence which will signal when job is done. But I am not aware of anything 
where it would be a problem either. One to run past driver maintainers I 
guess.

Well fence_kill_context wasn't self-descriptive to me neither so there 
is that too. In other words some kerneldoc will be needed anyway and a 
callback to call while tearing something down is pretty standard stuff. 
So I don't think it is a big deal to explain what that callback should do.

Given it is an opt-in fair enough. (Some drivers don't have automatic 
fence expiration, but then again they don't have this callback either. 
And once they start adding it, there will be kerneldoc to say callback 
must not block.)
