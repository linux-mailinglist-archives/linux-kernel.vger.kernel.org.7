And will be extended once they have the corresponding async implementation in
the driver.

We are not debating the number you set in MSM, we're talking about whether a
statically set number will be sufficient.

Also, do we really want it to be our quality standard that we introduce some
throttling mechanism as generic infrastructure for driver and don't even add a
comment guiding drivers how to choose a proper limit and what are the potential
pitfalls in choosing the limit?

When working on a driver, do you want to run into APIs that don't give you
proper guidance on how to use them correctly?

I think it would not be very nice to tell drivers, "Look, here's a throttling API
for when VK CTS (unknown test) ruins your day. We also can't give any advise on
the limit that should be set depending on the scale of the machine, since we
never looked into it.".

Yes, but the ring buffer as a resource is owned by the scheduler, and hence
having the scheduler care about flow control makes sense.

Here you want to flow control the uAPI (i.e. VM_BIND ioctl) -- let's do this in
a seaparate component please.

Yes, but you also implicitly force drivers to actually release the pre-allocated
memory before the scheduler's internal waitqueue is woken. Having such implicit
rules isn't nice.

Also, with that drivers would need to do so in run_job(), i.e. in the fence
signalling critical path, which some drivers may not be able to do.

And, it also adds complexity to the scheduler, which we're trying to reduce.

All this goes away with making this a separate component -- please do that
instead.
