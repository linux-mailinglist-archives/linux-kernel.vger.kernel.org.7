Google users got annoyed with these rounding errors very quickly and
asked me to change the MBA interface to the raw, fixed-point value
used by the MPAM register interface. (but at least shifted down, since
the MBW_MIN/MAX fields are left-justified)

MBA is not programmed by percentage on AMD, so I'm not sure why this
is considered necessary for backwards compatibility.
