Not really - other DTS sent just few days ago created each entry per one
register.

That's still system controller. It's nothing special here.

No, owner is the parent device always.

regmap synchronizes everything. There is no problem here, at all.

You still do not have multiple subnodes, one per each register or even
few registers.
