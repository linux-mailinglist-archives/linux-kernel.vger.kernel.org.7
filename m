To avoid confusion with regulator-level constraints, I'm open to 
renaming the property vdda-phy-max-microamp to something more 
descriptive, such as vdda-phy-client-peak-load-microamp or 
vdda-phy-peak-load-microamp. Along with updating the description, this 
would better reflect the property's actual intent: to specify the 
maximum current a client may draw during peak operation, rather than 
implying it defines the regulatorâ€™s maximum capability.


Having said that, I had a follow-up discussion with the PHY designer to 
confirm whether this value could vary at the board level. Based on their 
response, it's a fixed value for the SoC and does not change across 
different boards(atleast for now). Therefore, I can remove from device 
tree and replaced with hardcoded, per-compatible data in the driver.
