It may be a bit arbitrary, but then again I'm not sure that userspace
is in any better position to pick an appropriate limit.

4MB of in-flight pages isn't going to be too much for anything that is
capable enough to run vk, but still allows for a lot of in-flight
maps.  As I mentioned before, I don't expect anyone to hit this case
normally, unless they are just trying to poke the driver in weird
ways.  Having the kernel guard against that doesn't seem unreasonable.
