So, the addition of:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e9cbc854d8b148e3491291fb615e94261970fb54

  perf config: Add a function to set one variable in .perfconfig

  To allow for setting a variable from some other tool, like with the
  "wallclock" patchset needs to allow the user to opt-in to having
  that key in the sort order for 'perf report'.

  Cc: Dmitriy Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>


Was to tell the user about the new possibilities of profiling, once,
with something like:

root@number:~# perf report
             ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
             │Do you want to use latency mode?                     │
             │That will add a 'Latency' column that would mean     │
             │'wall-clock' time when used with cycles, for instance│
             │                                                     │
             │                                                     │
             │Enter: Yes, ESC: No                                  │
             └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 
The working should inform if the current perf.data has what is needed
and thus this would take immediate effect, and if not, inform that as
well and what is needed to be able to use that, things like you
described above:

> First, record needs to collect additional info and that may be
> somewhat expensive.

If the user says that the feature is desired by pressing Enter, follow
up questions can be asked as well, like you described:

> Second, report now has several modes:

>  - it can show latency, but order by the current overhead
>  - it can also show latency, and order by latency

> A user wants one or another depending on what they are optimizing

Once these are answered, the questions goes away, as they are now
recorded in the user's ~/.perfconfig file and will be used when what is
needed is present in perf.data file.

The user should also be informed that to change that knob, 'perf config'
is your friend.

Additionally some hotkey could be made available to change that
behaviour, on the fly, with the option of turning the new mode the new
default, again writing to ~/.perfconfig.

Sometimes this "on the fly" needs reprocessing of the whole perf.data
file, sometimes it may be a matter of just showing extra available
fields, like the 'V' key now, that goes on bumping the verbosity in the
'perf report' and 'perf top' browsers (they share the hists browser), or
'j' that toogles showing the lines from jump sources to jump targets in
the annotate browser, 'J' to show how many jumps target a particular
jump target, also in the annotate browser, etc.

This could help experimenting with the various modes of doing profiling,
interactively, to see the problem from different angles, without having
to restart the whole process by exiting the 'perf report' to add new
command line options, then restart, etc, reusing computation sometimes
when switching views, etc.

To get default behaviour its just a matter of renaming ~/.perfconfig to
~/.perfconfig.some_suitabe_name_for_later_use.

This way interesting new features like this don't get buried behind
either command line options nor man pages, giving the user at least an
opportunity to be informed about it.

That is what the patch below barely starts sketching, not doing all I
just described.
