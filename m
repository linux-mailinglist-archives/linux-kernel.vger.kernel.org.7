I would think a better indicator of performance improvement would be
to measure the system time when running the find commands.  (i.e.,
either using getrusange with RUSAGE_CHILDREN or wait3 or wait4).

We're trading off some extra memory usage and code complexity with
less CPU time because entries in the kmem_cache might be more TLB
friendly.  But this is only really going to be applicable if the
directory is large enough such that the cycles spent in readdir is
significant compared to the rest of the userspace program, *and* you
are reading the directory multiple times (e.g., calling find on a
directory hierarchy many, many times) such that the disk blocks are
cahed and you don't need to read them from the storage device.
Otherwise the I/O costs will completely dominate and swamp the
marginal TLB cache savings.

Given that it's really rare for readdir() to be the bottleneck of many
workloads, the question is, is it worth it?
