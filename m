Hello Tejun,

Thanks!

Let's see if I understood what you mean.

>- Separate out patches to add the new flag and wq. Don't add the warnings
>  yet. I'll commit these patches to a separate wq branch.

Basically these means have 2 more patches, one for WQ_PERCPU (only the
new flag, like in the v1 let's say) and another patch that adds the wq(s).

So, all the logic changes (also in __alloc_workqueue), pr_warn_once() will
stay in the other patch (that you will apply later); this is not only 1 pat=
ch,
following your next point.

If I understood correctly, it makes sense to me.

This impacts patch 3, so instead of 1 big patch, you are thinking of N patc=
hes,
in order to add WQ_PERCPU to the callers of subsystems first.

So, something like:
- net/
- mm/
- fs/

Do you have something different in mind?

Sounds good.

Thank you again.
