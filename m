Yes, I agree.

So the whole clockevent / clocksource drivers policy would have to be making
impossible to unload a module once it is loaded.

Do you have any ideas how to ensure that the converted drivers follow this
rule without putting more burden on the maintainer?

Yes, that is that kind of issue I suspect.

When the first driver converted as a module will be accepted, I'm pretty sure
there will be a wave of patches to convert more drivers into modules. 

What tool / use cases / tests can we put in place to ensure it is not breaking
the existing platforms for the different configurations?

But in the context of modules, the current clocksource counter is running but
what about the clocksource's counter related to the module which will be
started when the driver is loaded and then switches to the new clocksource. Is
it possible in this case there is a time drift between the clocksource which
was started at boot time and the one started later when the module is loaded ?

Ok let's consider my comment as out of the technical aspects of the changes. I
can clarify it but it does not enter into consideration for the module
conversion. It is an overall feeling about the direction of all in modules for
GKI policy. I'm a little worried about changes not carried on mainline because
it is no longer an obstacle to keep OoT drivers. The core kernel is mainline
but the drivers can be vendor provided as module. I understand it is already
the case but the time framework is the base brick of the system, so there is
the risk a platform is supported with less than the minimum functionality.
