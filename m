I know it's not reading a remote MIDR, that would be crazy :)

But iterating over per-cpu variables sucks and we should be able to avoid
it because this code already knows how to detect features locally.

I think if you want to go down that route, then this needs to be detected
locally on each CPU.

I was hoping that it would mean that each CPU can independently determine
whether or not they have the erratum and then enable it as soon as they
detect it. That way, there's no need to iterate over all the early cores.
