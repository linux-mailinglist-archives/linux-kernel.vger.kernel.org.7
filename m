Hi,

I don't think this qualifies as a CVE, the issue was more theoretical. But
I don't have much experience with what deserves a CVE and what not, so I
can just present some insights:

So "potentially invalid data read from the ROM" is an issue the we have
regardless, this patch doesn't change that. And you cannot put arbitrary
voltages or frequencies in the OTP fuses, the value read is just used to
select one of the OPPs defined in the DT. If you want to attack the
system by heavily overclocking or baking it with a high voltage, you can
just change the limits in the DT. Not sure if that's easier or harder than
accessing the hardware, though.

But more importantly, looking at this particular patch: This effectively
limits the access size of the value we read from the SID OTP driver, from
always 4 bytes to what the DT says, typically 2 bytes. But we actually
mask the value in the code anyway later at the moment, so the upper 16
bits are always discarded.
Which means that as it stands at the moment, there is no real change in
what values are used. I just did the change as it was clearly incorrect,
and I wanted to prevent any issues, in case of code changes later.

Hope that helps!

Cheers,
Andre
