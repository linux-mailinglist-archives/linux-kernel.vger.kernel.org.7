Hi Alex,

I still don=E2=80=99t understand your use case 100% :/

>=20
> I just mean the cases where users will want to enable and disable the
> regulator more frequently than just enabling it at probe time.

This is already possible through kernel::types::Either.=20

i.e.: the current design - or the proposed typestate one - can already =
switch
back and forth between Regulator and EnabledRegulator. Using Either =
makes it
just work, because you can change the variant at runtime without hassle. =
This
lets you consume self in an ergonomic way.

By the way, the reason I'm pushing back slightly here is because you =
seem
(IIUC) to be trying to reintroduce the pattern we had to move away from =
in v1.

i.e.: we explicitly had to move away from trying to match enables and =
disables
in Rust, because it was hard to get this right.

The current design is a simplification that apparently works, because at =
best
you have +1 on the count and that is encoded in the type itself, so =
there is
nothing to actually "track" or "balance" within a given instance. =
Multiple
calls to _get() or _enable() on the same instance are simply forbidden.

Can you add some pseudocode that shows how this doesn't work (or is =
otherwise
unergonomic) in Nova? I think it will make your point clearer.

I see now, but consuming self is something we're trying after =
considering the
&mut self approach, which did not work very well in v1.

This is explicitly not supported, because (given the current code) why =
should it be?

If you want a given regulator to be enabled, just make sure you have
Regulator<Enabled> in your kernel::types::Either container.

You don't need a counter either: Regulator<Enabled> has a count of one, =
and
when that goes out of scope, it's decremented.

I thought we had agreed that there is no =E2=80=9CDisabled=E2=80=9D, =
even in C?

Can you expand a bit on the issues of changing types? Again, some =
pseudocode
will probably help a lot :)
