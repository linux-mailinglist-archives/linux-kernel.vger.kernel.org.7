Those aren't documented in Rockchip's TRM (Technical Reference Manual) 
as far as I could tell, hence why I asked for Kever's input on that. We 
could empirically find direct correlation to a specific value but I 
cannot do this for every version of the IP we have in all Rockchip SoCs 
as I only have access to a handful :)

I see, I think I took this 2ns too critically. I thought we really were 
supposed to be close to it but thanks to the tip about the RGMII spec[1] 
we can see that the delay at transmitter needs to be between 1.2 and 2ns 
while at the receiver it needs to be between 1 and 2ns. So "at least 
1.5ns" granularity in the PHY is good enough for us :) (and we verified 
it works of course :) )

Note that Rockchip SoCs typically have integrated PHYs as well (which we 
don't use at CHERRY but the option is there). The answer otherwise is 
usually of the kind of "we followed the reference design, it works with 
the DT from the evaluation board, this DT was accepted, we do the same". 
For contributors, I don't think it's feasible to figure out whether the 
PCB lane length matching is done properly or how much is actually 
required except by modifying the delay by hand and find both extremes 
where it stops working and empirically decide the eye is in the middle 
of those (for your board, which may differ from another board of the 
same kind).

Clear thanks. I'm not sure whether Linux already has a way for the MAC 
to provide which delay the PHY is supposed to do? I (now) know we can 
override the phy_mode via one of phy_attach*/phy_connect* function which 
take a phy_interface_t as argument. I see a phy_get_internal_delay but 
not the setter part of it. Anyway, don't want to drag this too much as I 
don't need this anymore since the delay will be added by the PHY.

Thanks to your and Jakob (in private)'s explanations, I now understand 
that this is very likely not required as I would assume HW engineers for 
the IC would essentially allow to add some delay between 1.2ns and 2ns 
to satisfy the RGMII v2.0 spec but there's no need to be precise or have 
granularity. So this scenario is theoretical and could very likely be 
due to accumulated HW mistakes (either in ICs or routing)?

I assume we would therefore need some kind of negotiation between the 
PHY and the MAC at the subsystem level to figure out if the PHY can do 
the requested delay or if it should be handled by the MAC instead?

Just need to be in the 1-2ns but otherwise I fully agree, thanks for the 
hint of the RGMII spec that helped!

Thanks for taking the time to write this all down and your patience, 
that was all very helpful!
