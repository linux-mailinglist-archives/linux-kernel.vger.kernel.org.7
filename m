In short, I prefer to store perf handle in coresight path, as Jie has
done in this series.

I will give details below, sorry for a long replying.

Yes, renaming 'coresight_path' (to like 'coresight_runtime_ctx') better
reflects the structureâ€™s purpose.

The point is we can take chance to separate runtime parameters from
device and driver instances.

  - 'coresight_path': runtime parameters for an active session
  - 'coresight_device': a device instance registered on the bus
  - driver data: after probe, the driver maintains driver-specific
    attributes (e.g., the ETMv4 driver keeps mode and filters in struct
    etmv4_drvdata)

These structures have different lifetimes. For example, coresight_path
is valid only during a session; otherwise, it should be cleared.

From a lifecycle perspective, storing the perf handle in coresight_path
makes sense, since both are valid only for the duration of a session
(the perf handle isn't used in sysfs mode, in which case we can simply
leave it unset).

Furthermore, the perf handle is not just a handle; it lets us easily
retrieve private event data (see perf_get_aux()).

We need to be careful for exporting data structures across modules, as
it makes them harder to manage.

In fact, we already share 'etm_event_data' for ETR driver for the same
purpose, and seems to me, it is redendant to export another structure
'etm_ctxt' to just make it convenient for obtaining a buffer config
pointer.

I'd suggest a different approach: drop the etm_ctxt structure and
instead define a per-CPU pointer to etm_event_data:

  static DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct etm_event_data *, etm_ev_ctx);

As mentioned above, if perf handle is maintained in coresight_path, we
can easily retrieve the etm_event_data via the perf handle.

A more aggressive refactoring would remove etm_ctxt from
coresight-etm-perf.c entirely, relying on the perf event to manage
private context data. For now, we keep it only to validate whether
ETM is enabled (see multiple place to validate ctxt->event_data).

Thanks,
Leo
