I'm more of thinking that if those special cases are detectable rather than a set of ambiguous rules then we might address those quirks in a way better than #ifdefs. For "extended linear cache", it is detected via HMAT spec change. So while only Intel implements this right now on a platform, other vendors can and may in the future. The LMH is more difficult as there are no are no standard ways to enumerate it. Hopefully a set of clear rules will define this. It does look like Dan is trying to get the CXL spec to clearly define this and discussion in the WG is coming in the next couple weeks. The AMD translation can be detected by seeing if certain ACPI callback methods exist right? Is there more required to detect the special translation needs to be applied? But I do agree with the reducing complexity for maintenance and future implementations.
