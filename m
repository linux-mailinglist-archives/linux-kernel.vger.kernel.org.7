set_mode() just applies the mode to the regulator_dev, so in cases where
you have multiple consumers of a regulator_dev things would break.

Further, there are numerous cases where we have multiple consumers each
needing a "low" mode, but their combined load requires a "high" mode.

set_load() and its aggregation of the inputs deals with both of these
issues.


Whether mode setting is becoming less relevant in our hardware, that I
don't have the definitive answer to.

If this is our reason for putting it in DeviceTree, then we should write
that in the commit message :)

I agree, even if we determine that this belongs in DT, because it needs
to be tweaked on a per-board basis, it's still only applicable to a
fraction of our device nodes.
