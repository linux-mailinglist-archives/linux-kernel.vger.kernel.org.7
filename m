Creating the bus is successful, but there's an EPROBE_DEFER failure after
that. Which induces the probe loop as described in my initial email.

I will have a look. However, I expect both of these approaches to
require fairly invasive conversions for existing drivers. Ideally, I
would like to keep conversions simple.
