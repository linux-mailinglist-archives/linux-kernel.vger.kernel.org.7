There was some discussion on this at LSF-MM.

+CC Keith and Jerome who were once interested in this topic

It's not perfect but ACPI HMAT does have what is probably sufficient info
for a simple case like this (2 socket server + Generic Ports and CXL
description of the rest of the path), it's just that today we aren't exposing that
to userspace (instead only the BW / Latency from a single selected nearest initiator
/CPU node to any memory containing node).

That decision was much discussed back when Keith was adding HMAT support.
At that time the question was what workload needed the dense info (2D matrix)
and we didn't have one.  With weighted interleave I think we do.

As to the problems...

We come unstuck badly in much more complex situations as that information
is load free so if we have heavy contention due to one shared link between
islands of nodes it can give a very misleading idea.

  [CXL Node 0]                         [CXL Node 2]
       |                                    |
   [NODE A]---\                    /----[NODE C]
               \___Shared link____/ 
               /                  \
   [NODE B]---/                    \----[NODE D]
       |                                   |
  [CXL Node 1]                         [CXL Node 3]

In this from ACPI this looks much like this (fully connected
4 socket system).

  [CXL Node 0]                         [CXL Node 2]
       |                                    |
   [NODE A]-----------------------------[NODE C]
       |   \___________________________   / | 
       |    ____________________________\/  |  
       |   /                             \  | 
   [NODE B]-----------------------------[NODE D]
       |                                   |
  [CXL Node 1]                         [CXL Node 3]

In the first case we should probably halve the BW of shared link or something
like that. In the second case use the full version. In general we have no way
to know which one we have and it gets way more fun with 8 + sockets :)

SLIT is indeed useless for anything other than what's nearest decisions

Anyhow, short term I'd like us to revisit what info we present from HMAT
(and what we get from CXL topology descriptions which have pretty much everything we
might want).

That should put the info in userspace to tune weighted interleave better anyway
and perhaps provide the info you need here. 

So just all the other problems to solve ;)
