Changes since v13 following reviews by Kai:

 - changed implementation of sgx_inc_usage_count() to 
 only increment the sgx_usage_count at the end of
 function and adjusted the counter check inside sgx_update_svn().
 No functional changes here. 
 - fixed two more formatting/comments issues pointed by Kai

Changes since v12 following reviews by Kai:

 - added review-by from Kai on patches 1 & 3
 - fixed sgx_inc_usage_count() to decrement the sgx_usage_count
 in a rare case when sgx_update_svn() fails. The latter
 is really an exceptional scenario (hw failure or
 explicit attack/heavy load on RNG) and that's why the
 fast path (increment by default) is left as it is. 

Changes since v11 following reviews by Kai and Jarkko:

 - added review-by from Jarkko on the whole series
 - fixed all format and commit issues pointed out by Kai

Changes since v10 following reviews by Dave:

 - merge patch 1 and 2
 - patch 1: clarify the comment about the function prototype
 - patch 3: clarify the description of SGX_NO_UPDATE
  error code, move the definition of EUPDATESVN enum leaf
  to patch 4
 - patch 4: clarify commit, adjust sgx_update_svn() function
  according to feedback

Changes since v9 following reviews by Kai:

 - postpone the definition of sgx_inc_usage_count
   until patch 6
 - clarify the commit message in patch 6
 - minor fixes

Note: I didn't merge patch 1 and 2 since it goes against
previous suggestion made by Jarkko.

Changes since v8 following reviews by Dave and Jarkko:

 - fix the sgx_inc/dec_usage_count() to not do any
 actual counting until the later patch when adequate
 mutex is introduced as suggested by Dave
 - add an additional patch (patch 1) to redefine
 existing sgx_(vepc_)open into wrappers to allow
 the follow up patch to introduce the sgx_inc/dec_usage_count()
 functions into sgx_(vepc_)open cleanly as suggested
 by Jarkko. 

Changes since v7 following reviews by Dave:

 - change sgx_usage_count to be a normal int type
 and greatly simplify the sgx_inc_usage_count func.
 This results in requiring a mutex for each sgx_(vepc_)open
 but given that the mutex is held a short amount of
 time it should be ok perf-wise.

Changes since v6 following reviews by Kai,Jarkko
and Dave:

 - fix sgx_update_svn function description
 - add maybe_unused for sgx_update_svn in patch 4
 to silence the warning, remove it in patch 5
 - add note to patch 1 explaining why the prototype
 sgx_inc_usage_count returns int and not void
 - fix the order of return code checks in 
 sgx_update_svn
 - cosmetic fixes
 
Note: I didn't change the sgx_inc/dec_usage_count
to statics because they are called from a number of
different code locations and also rely on a static
sgx_usage_count, which lives naturally in main.c.  
 
Changes since v5 following reviews by Ingo, Kai,
Jarkko and Dave:

 - rebase on x86 tip
 - patch 1 is fixed to do correct unwinding in
 case of errors
 - patch 2: add feature flag to cpuid-deps.c
 - patch 3: remove unused SGX_EPC_NOT_READY error code
 - patch 4: fix x86 feature check, return -EAGAIN
 on SGX_INSUFFICIENT_ENTROPY and -EIO on other non-
 expected errors. Comments/style are also fixed.
 - patch 5: rewrite commit message, add comments inline

Changes since v4 following reviews by Dave and Jarkko:

 - breakdown the single patch into 4 patches as
 suggested by Dave
 - fix error unwinding in sgx_(vepc_)open as 
 suggested by Jarkko
 - numerous code improvements suggested by Dave
 - numerous additional code comments and commit
 message improvements as suggested by Dave
 - switch to usage of atomic64_t for sgx_usage_count
 to ensure overflows cannot happen as suggested by Dave
 - do not return a error case when failing with
 SGX_INSUFFICIENT_ENTROPY, fail silently as suggested
 by Dave

Changes since v3 following reviews by Kai and Sean:

 - Change the overall approach to the one suggested
  by Sean and do the EUPDATESVN execution during
  sgx_open() and sgx_vepc_open().
  Note, I do not try to do EUPDATESVN during the release()
  flows since it doesnt save any noticable amount
  of time during next open flow per underlying EUPDATESVN
  microcode logic.
 - In sgx_update_svn() remove the check that we are
  running under VMM and expect the VMM to instead
  expose correct CPUID
 - Move the actual CPUID leaf check out of
  sgx_update_svn() into sgx_init()
 - Use existing RDRAND_RETRY_LOOPS define instead of 10
 - Change the sgx_update_svn() to return 0 only in
 success cases (or if unsupported)
 - Various smaller cosmetic fixes

The still to be discussed question is what sgx_update_svn()
should return in case of various failures. The current version
follows suggestion by Kai and would return an error (and block
sgx_(vepc_)open() in all cases, including running out of entropy.
I think this might be the correct approach for SGX_INSUFFICIENT_ENTROPY
since in such cases userspace can retry the open() and also
will get an info about what is actually blocking the EUPDATEVSN
(and can act on this). However, this is a change in existing API
and therefore debatable and I would like to hear people's feedback.

Changes since v2 following review by Jarkko:

 - formatting of comments is fixed
 - change from pr_error to ENCLS_WARN to communicate errors from
 EUPDATESVN
 - In case an unknown error is detected (must not happen per spec),
 make page allocation from EPC fail in order to prevent EPC usage

Changes since v1 following review by Jarkko:

 - first and second patch are squashed together and a better
   explanation of the change is added into the commit message
 - third and fourth patch are also combined for better understanding
   of error code purposes used in 4th patch
 - implementation of sgx_updatesvn adjusted following Jarkko's 
   suggestions
 - minor fixes in both commit messages and code from the review
 - dropping co-developed-by tag since the code now differs enough
   from the original submission. However, the reference where the
   original code came from and credits to original author is kept

Background
----------

In case an SGX vulnerability is discovered and TCB recovery
for SGX is triggered, Intel specifies a process that must be
followed for a given vulnerability. Steps to mitigate can vary
based on vulnerability type, affected components, etc.
In some cases, a vulnerability can be mitigated via a runtime
recovery flow by shutting down all running SGX enclaves,
clearing enclave page cache (EPC), applying a microcode patch
that does not require a reboot (via late microcode loading) and
restarting all SGX enclaves.


Problem statement
-------------------------
Even when the above-described runtime recovery flow to mitigate the
SGX vulnerability is followed, the SGX attestation evidence will
still reflect the security SVN version being equal to the previous
state of security SVN (containing vulnerability) that created
and managed the enclave until the runtime recovery event. This
limitation currently can be only overcome via a platform reboot,
which negates all the benefits from the rebootless late microcode
loading and not required in this case for functional or security
purposes.


Proposed solution
-----------------

SGX architecture introduced  a new instruction called EUPDATESVN [1]
to Ice Lake. It allows updating security SVN version, given that EPC
is completely empty. The latter is required for security reasons
in order to reason that enclave security posture is as secure as the
security SVN version of the TCB that created it.

This series enables opportunistic execution of EUPDATESVN upon first
EPC page allocation for a first enclave to be run on the platform.

This series is partly based on the previous work done by Cathy Zhang
[2], which attempted to enable forceful destruction of all SGX
enclaves and execution of EUPDATESVN upon successful application of
any microcode patch. This approach is determined as being too
intrusive for the running SGX enclaves, especially taking into account
that it would be performed upon *every* microcode patch application
regardless if it changes the security SVN version or not (change to the
security SVN version is a rare event).

Testing
-------

Tested on EMR machine using kernel 6.17.0_rc1 & sgx selftests.
Also tested on a Kaby Lake machine without EUPDATESVN support.
If Google folks in CC can test on their side, it would be greatly
appreciated.
