Hi Brian,

Thanks for your patch

I think it would be worth documenting (some parts of) clk_core. Starting
with that new field looks like a good idea.

There's something I don't quite understand here, sorry.

new_rate here is the parent rate, but child->rate is the current (as in,
currently programmed in hardware) rate.

> +		child->new_rate =3D clk_recalc(child, tmp_rate);

And child->new_rate is the future rate we will try to enforce when we'll
actually perform the rate change.

In the case where rate_directly_changed is set to false, you thus asks
for the future rate a clock will have, using its former rate as input?

I think that breaks the rate propagation for all the
rate_directly_changed=3Dfalse clocks.

It probably works in div_div_2 test case because you're using an
(implicit) divider of 1 for both child1 and child2.

So, child1 =3D=3D child2 =3D=3D parent =3D=3D 24MHz.

Thus, child2->rate will be 24MHz, new_rate would be 48MHz, and thus
using child2->rate instead of new_rate would work because we indeed have
the old parent rate and the new child2 rate lined up.

But from a logical point-of-view, it doesn't really work, and I'm sure
it would break some platforms too.

My understanding of the clk_change_rate logic is that you would get in
that test something like:

parent->rate =3D 24MHz
child1->rate =3D 24MHz? (it's implicit, we should probably improve that by =
setting it and using an assertion)
child2->rate =3D 24MHz? (Ditto)

then with the call to clk_set_rate,

parent->new_rate =3D 48MHz
child1->new_rate =3D 48MHz
child2->new_rate =3D 48MHz? (probably, since we keep the same divider)

So we want child2->new_rate to be what child2->rate is (or better,
req_rate if it was set, but we don't really have a way to tell afaik).

Unfortunately, I don't see an easy way to do that. My first thought
would be to use clk_core_determine_round_nolock() with a clk_request
with new_rate as the parent rate, and child->req_rate as the target
rate.

However, calling round_rate or determine_rate might affect the parent
rate, which is not something we want here.

Maybe we could clean up a bit req_rate to turn it into an optional value
(either 0 or a rate) that would allow us to tell if something has set
it, and if not we know we can fall back to clk->rate.

Then, we have a useful (for this anyway) req_rate, and we could add a
flag to round_rate and determine_rate to let drivers know that they
can't update their parent or parent rate, just report what they can do
with that set of parameters.

I guess it can even be that we convert everyone to determine_rate, and
repurpose round_rate for this?
