Can you include test setup instructions on this patch series cover
letter? I was having a lot of trouble trying to set up the system to
reproduce the results in the past. I think the default setup
compresses data very poorly - there were lots of compression failure
reported by zswap...

I still don't understand where these numbers come from. How do you
evaluate memory savings? Do you just compare peak memory usage? zstd
has better compression ratio, as you pointed out below (2.23 vs 2.96)

Why is there so much more swap failure here? For 2M, this doesn't seem
to be the case.

Similarly, why are we falling back more?

Interesting. So there's some negative interaction between the new NUMA
node selection behavior and your patch?

64K number looks good. Usemem numbers probably don't matter as much as this=

The 2M number looks decent too. Seems like the "regression" in
real_sec for zstd comes from the disk swapping activity (see below)

Looks like there are 1026 pages swapped out to disk, which are all
swapped back in?

I assume this is due to compression failure?

So the numbers above are already with these changes to recover performance?
