Ok, I think we need to see some "real" examples here of the api in use
before figuring it out further as I'm totally confused :)

Yes, we need to be able to have a debugfs file callback handle a mutable
structure in order to lock things correctly.  We also need to have it be
mutable so that it can MODIFY the value (everyone seems to forget that
debugfs allows that...)

So how about a platform driver that exposes values read from a platform
device (i.e. a soc info driver), that also includes a
local-to-the-device data structure that can be locked and modified?
That should cover all the use cases that I can think of at the moment.
