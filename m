How so? IIUC the order in which slots are freed depends on the LRU (for
writeback) and swapins (for loads). Why do we expect that slots from the
same block will be freed in close succession?

Could you share a high-level description of how this issue will be
addressed in zblock? I am trying to understand why/how zblock can handle
this better/simpler than zsmalloc.

That's good to know. I don't have specific workloads in mind, was just
stating the fact that zsmalloc has been tested with a variety of
workloads in production environments.

This does not answer my question tho. I am trying to understand what
makes zblock faster than zsmalloc.

If it's the (optionally opportunistic) higher order allocations, we can
probably do the same in zsmalloc and avoid memcpys as well. I guess we
can try to allocate zspages as a high-order contiguous allocation first,
and fallback to the current "chain" structure on failure.

If it's the lack of overhead from compaction (e.g. less locking), then
the question should be why does zsmalloc need compaction and zblock
allegedly doesn't?

I am not arguing that you're seeing better results from zblock, what I
am saying is let's pinpoint what makes zblock better first, then decide
whether the same can be applied to zsmalloc or if it's really better to
create a new allocator instead. Right now we don't have full
information.

WDYT?
