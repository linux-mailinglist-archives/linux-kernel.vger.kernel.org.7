I had thought that since the addresses were already there in vendor's DT 
[2], and the names were provided by SpacemiT, anything other than the 
names was "well-known information". In retrospect, I should have made 
the chain of information of this clearer and make it explicit that this 
was based on Guodong's note.

So, just to be clear, the information in my proposal is based on 
Guodong's reply [1] (link the quoted text), which I had assumed, but not 
explicitly confirmed, was based on already addresses in SpacemiT's DT 
and names provided by SpacemiT.

Yeah, that's my mistake in organizing the paragraphs.

Hmm, actually re-reading the discussion now, I realized that I may have 
come to this late and missed out on some previous discussions, which 
were alluded to in Yixun's messages. (This is again thread around link 
[1] in quoted text.) This led me to believe that some of these were not 
really agreed upon.

I also realized I think one of the things I may have not yet made clear 
is that I would like the bus node to be a *separate* patch. I think this 
makes sense, because it's dealing with two different subsystems.

Being thorough was the main goal of this RFC. If there was previous 
agreement on how dma-ranges should be done, I'm sorry for missing them, 
but from my observations on the mailing list on how these ended up into 
patches I really haven't seen much consistency. Maybe there was 
misunderstanding, which I'm hoping to clear up.

(Although see my paragraph above, maybe I haven't been thorough enough.)

That was a good summary. Thanks!

My main goal of organizing the bus this way is making it actually pass 
"make dtbs_check". I'm not sure if Krzysztof still objects to my reading 
of simple-bus.yaml though.

By the way, I don't think I will be making an RFC v2 of this. I think we 
should get everything sorted under this one thread.

Thanks again for taking a look.
