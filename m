Right, it is an aside, though an important one.

Hm, but no, it doesn't annul glibc's protection, right?

The concern is that:
a. musl doesn't implement LD_PRELOAD clearing
b. with NNP, setuid-exec followed by setting NNP followed by exec,
   will lead to different behavior from non-NNP.  In non-NNP,
   you'll continue to have euid=0, ruid=1000, and caps.  With NNP,
   you'll have euid=ruid=1000, and still full caps.

So, if someone is using NNP believing that it is a safe way to
execute untrusted code with privilege, because they see they
are now uid 1000, they will be confused.  Worse, they are
subject with musl to LD_PRELOAD from the user before setuid-root.

So two things we can do are

1. have NNP drop privilege.
2. have NNP not force euid to be ruid.

(1) sort of makes sense since you've bothered to use NNP, but
as Max, who is a user of NNP, says, that is not the behavior
that would be useful to him.  It also leaves the non-NNP and
NNP exec behavior - which is already - obviously - far too
complicated - with yet more cases.

(2) is concerning because it is a change in behavior for NNP
users, but on the other hand, it leaves us with fewer special
cases.

At this point I'm kind of leaning towards (2), though with the
obvious modification Max has already found should be added (for
secureexec).

Max is such a user.  I don't know what we can do to get input from
more users.  Perhaps scan the debian codebase results at

  https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=NO_NEW_PRIVS&literal=1

I'll take a look through those in a bit.
