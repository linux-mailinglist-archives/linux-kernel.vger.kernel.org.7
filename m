I'm in a similar boat, while trying to make DSI run on the rk3576.
Andy from Rockchip was able to make it work "just" by using vendor-
firmware - while using mainline u-boot (with both mainline TF-A
or vendor TF-A) produces just black output.

I think when I did the mainline u-boot thing I took the "vendor"-code
from the armbian rk3576 vendor-u-boot ... but that actually may differ
from what the vendors provided?

Because at least looking at that code did not show any clock differences
to me.
