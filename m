KHO already accesses stuct page early and uses page->private for order.
Since preserved memory is reserved in memblock, deferred init of struct
pages won't touch those pages, we just need to make sure they are properly 
initialized at some point. If we don't expect many kho_restore_folio()
before page_alloc_init_late() we can use init_deferred_page() for early
accesses.
