Umm, can you please explain how exactly I am circumventing "normal" 
devicetree overlay interface and discussion here. If I submit spec or 
devicetree compiler changes, nobody responds. And when I submit the full 
driver, it ends up with it not being the way upstream wants. And I have 
not seen any of Herve and Luca's subsystem specific patches for addon 
board + connector setups accepted yet. So if there is a place where I 
can discuss things regarding the addon board + connector setup more 
before writing full implementations, I would really love that.

I have added Herve and Luca here as well, if they want to add something.
