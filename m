It doesn't have to. If the previous dirty version of the key is on cache device
already, and power off happens, even the clean version of the key is gone, the
dirty version and its data are all valid. If the LBA range of this key is
allocated to a new key, a GC must have alrady happened, and the dirty key is
invalid due to bucket generation increased. So don't worry, the clean key is
unncessary to go into journal in the writeback scenario.
 
IMHO, you may try to flush backing device in a kworker before calling
set_gc_sectors() in bch_gc_thread(). The disk cache can be flushed in time
before the still-dirty-on-disk keys are invalidated by increase bucket key
gen. And also flushing backing device after searched_full_index becomes
true in the writeback thread main loop (as you did now).

Flushing backing device after read_dirty() returns is too heavy, event with
the flush hint keys. And the flushing operations are unnecessary before the
keys are reclaimed by garbage collaction.

Just my suggestion for your consideration.

Thanks.
