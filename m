As a note, I'm on vacation for three weeks and avoiding accessing work e=
mails, so won't be able to discuss this with Jackie properly until I'm b=
ack.

For history/context - this particular driver was a bit of a oddity as th=
e Ideapads aren't in the Lenovo Linux program (hope they will be one day=
). We had a Thinkbook that is using the same LUDS interface, that we wer=
e Linux certifying, and LED support is a requirement to work.

I do think this needs revisiting a bit. I am leaning to agreeing that it=
 shouldn't error out - but we were also being careful to not have this c=
ause problems on HW we ourselves don't have access to. It would be nice =
if it could be extended to more platforms though.

I don't have the specs handy right now (would need to go on the Lenovo V=
PN for that). Is it OK if we re-visit this when I'm back at home and wor=
king?
Jackie - please do have a look and think about this in the meantime.

Mark
