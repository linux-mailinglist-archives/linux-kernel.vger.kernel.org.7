Oh yeah, I didn't suggest an order, but rather a set of things :)

Yeah that looks good.

Ah we were talking about two different things. The functions take
`c_ulong`, but the definitions are pre-processor macros and thus don't
have a type annotation. That's why bindgen uses `u32`, because that's
the type that the constant fits in (AFAIK there are also some weird
rules in C about this? but don't quote me on that).

One way would be to turn the `#define`s into constants, but from
previous discussions I remember there were some reasons to not do that,
so I have no idea. The casts are unfortunate, but if we can't change the
C side to include the types in these constants, then it's fine.

But is it useful even without `SpinLockIrq`?

Do atomics work normally in IRQ context? (I know that Boqun's atomic
series also needs some work, so maybe not a good alternative)

I think that is better than including wrong examples with a caveat, as
some people might not read it or assume that the restriction somehow
doesn't apply to them.
