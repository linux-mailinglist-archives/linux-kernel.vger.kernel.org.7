Sorry for the delay in replying - other priorities.

Sorry if the previous descriptions hadn't been clear. All the same
points as for raspberrypi,pispbe.yaml apply here, which is why I'd
tried to link to it originally.

Describe the hardware:
Raspberry Pi designed and are the sole owners of the IP for this HEVC
decoder block. This is *not* Broadcom IP.

That design was given to Broadcom as Verilog to wire into the
bus/interrupt/clock fabric of BCM2711, and to manufacture it via TSMC
on a 28nm process node.

A few years later the same design was given to Broadcom to wire into
BCM2712, and to manufacture it on a 16nm process node.

As it is Raspberry Pi owned IP it can be used in other places than
Broadcom SoCs.
Broadcom does not have a licence to use the IP in any other of their chips.

It is the same situation as for raspberrypi,pispbe.yaml except the
block already exists in 2 chips rather than just the 1. There also
isn't a version register in the hardware that is different between
those chips (an oversight noted for future chips).
It could be compared to a Synopsis or Cadence IP block dropped into an
SoC. The vendor prefix happens to be raspberrypi instead of snps or
cdns.

Is there any part that needs to be further clarified?

It was another example of an IP block belonging to vendor A being
added into an SoC from vendor B, same as the situation here. Raspberry
Pi != Broadcom.
