Let me explain that better.  No filesystem followed the documented rule
that the refcount must be incremented by one if either PG_private or
PG_private_2 was set.  And no surprise; that's a very complicated rule
for filesystems to follow.  Many of them weren't even following the rule
to increment the refcount by one when PG_private was set.

So some were incrementing the refcount by one if PG_private were set, but
not bumping the refcount by one if PG_private_2 were set (I think this is
how btrfs worked, and you seem to believe the same thing).  Others were
bumping the refcount by two if both PG_private and PG_private_2 were set
(I think this is how netfs works today).

But that's another problem.  The current meaning of PG_fscache (and also
that has changed over the years!) is that the data in the folio is being
written to the fscache.  So we _shouldn't_ migrate the folio as some
piece of storage hardware is busy reading from the old folio.  And if
somebody else starts writing to the old folio, we'll have a corrupted
fscache.

So the current behaviour where we set private_2 and bump the refcount,
but don't take the private_2 status into account is the safe one,
because the elevated refcount means we'll skip the PG_fscache folio.
Maybe it'd be better to wait for it to clear.  But since Dave Howells
is busy killing it off, I'm just inclined to wait for that to happen.

Thank you!
