Commit comment cleanups to use present tense for background and
imperative for solution.

--- 15 ---
Enumeration of telemetry features is performed by sub-drivers
of the OOBMSM driver. These are loaded during device_init() time,
but the probe functions are triggered by deferred_probe_work_func()
which can happen after resctrl_init().
Tracing this procedure shows that it completes several seconds before
the earliest possible mount of the resctrl file system.

Updated Kconfig dependencies to require INTEL_TPMI=y so that all
drivers needed for enumeration are built in.

Fix commit to use imperative tone.

patches 16-20)


--- 20 ---
Moved stray list_add(&e->list, &active_event_groups); into patch 19
where it belongs.
Fixed kerneldoc comment for pmt_event::bin_bits to say this is number

s/passed/passes/ s/rmid/RMID/
Point out the explicit problem being solved with example of telemetry
counters needing the offset in MMIO space.

--- 22 ---
Drop local "eventid" in discover_events(). Use e->evts[i].id directly.
Change intel_aet_read_event() to return success if ANY aggregator has
valid data instead on only when ALL are valid. This matches existing
resctrl behaviour for providing a summed value for a CTRL_MON group
together with all child MON groups.

with an arch_priv pointer to the pmt_event.

--- 23 ---

to arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/intel_aet.c. Rename to
intel_aet_setup_mon_domain() to match pattern of other functions. Add
a stub to arch/x86/kernel/cpu/resctrl/internal.h for when
CONFIG_X86_CPU_RESCTRL_INTEL_AET is not set.
s/Intel-PMT-scoped/package scoped/

--- 24 ---
"that support is present" -> "that hardware support is present"
s/option/feature/

--- 25 ---
In check_rmid_count() change test to "if (tr->num_rmids < e->num_rmids)"
(i.e. if the number of hardware counters in the aggregator is fewer
than the number of counter locations in the MMIO region).
Eliminate the rdt_num_system_rmids variable.
"features" -> "feature's" (in comment for rdt_set_feature_disabled())
"h/w" -> "hardware" (three places in commit comment).

--- 26 ---
Function renames pulled into patch 11.
Drop the helper functions, just move the code to alloc/free
closid_num_dirty_rmid[] inline intoresctrl_mon_l3_resource_init()
and resctrl_mon_l3_resource_exit().
Fix leak of closid_num_dirty_rmid[] in resctrl_mon_l3_resource_init()
when dom_data_init() fails.
Note in commit comment that this change is prep for moving
the allocation rmid_ptrs[] to mount time.

--- 27 ---
Split into two parts:
0027:
	Update resctrl_arch_system_num_rmid_idx() to compute minimum
	RMID across resources.
0028: 
	Better function names.
	Rename: dom_data_init() -> setup_rmid_lru_list()
	Rename: dom_data_exit() -> free_rmid_lru_list()
	Move calls out of resctrl_mon_l3_resource_{init,exit}() and into
	rdt_get_tree(), resctrl_exit()
	Fix comment in setup_rmid_lru_list() about setup of rdtgroup_default.

--- 28 ---
Add check that RDT_RESOURCE_PERF_PKG resource is mon_capable. Also
set global rdt_mon_capable (to cover the case where there are no
enabled L3 monitor events).

--- 29 ---
Move declaration of debugfs_resctrl_info next to debugfs_resctrl.
s/debugs/debugfs/
Separate problem from context in commit comment.

Background
----------
On Intel systems that support per-RMID telemetry monitoring each logical
processor keeps a local count for various events. When the
IA32_PQR_ASSOC.RMID value for the logical processor changes (or when a
two millisecond counter expires) these event counts are transmitted to
an event aggregator on the same package as the processor together with
the current RMID value. The event counters are reset to zero to begin
counting again.

Each aggregator takes the incoming event counts and adds them to
cumulative counts for each event for each RMID. Note that there can be
multiple aggregators on each package with no architectural association
between logical processors and an aggregator.

All of these aggregated counters can be read by an operating system from
the MMIO space of the Out Of Band Management Service Module (OOBMSM)
device(s) on a system. Any counter can be read from any logical processor.

Intel publishes details for each processor generation showing which
events are counted by each logical processor and the offsets for each
accumulated counter value within the MMIO space in XML files here:
https://github.com/intel/Intel-PMT.

For example there are two energy related telemetry events for the
Clearwater Forest family of processors and the MMIO space looks like this:

Offset  RMID    Event
------  ----    -----
0x0000  0       core_energy
0x0008  0       activity
0x0010  1       core_energy
0x0018  1       activity
...
0x23F0  575     core_energy
0x23F8  575     activity

In addition the XML file provides the units (Joules for core_energy,
Farads for activity) and the type of data (fixed-point binary with
bit 63 used to indicate the data is valid, and the low 18 bits as a
binary fraction).

Finally, each XML file provides a 32-bit unique id (or guid) that is
used as an index to find the correct XML description file for each
telemetry implementation.

The INTEL_PMT_DISCOVERY driver provides intel_pmt_get_regions_by_feature()
to enumerate the aggregator instances (also referred to as "telemetry
regions" in this series) on a platform. It provides:

1) guid  - so resctrl can determine which events are supported
2) MMIO base address of counters
3) package id

Resctrl accumulates counts from all aggregators on a package in order
to provide a consistent user interface across processor generations.

Directory structure for the telemetry events looks like this:

$ tree /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
mon_data
├── mon_PERF_PKG_00
│   ├── activity
│   └── core_energy
└── mon_PERF_PKG_01
    ├── activity
    └── core_energy

Reading the "core_energy" file from some resctrl mon_data directory shows
the cumulative energy (in Joules) used by all tasks that ran with the RMID
associated with that directory on a given package. Note that "core_energy"
reports only energy consumed by CPU cores (data processing units,
L1/L2 caches, etc.). It does not include energy used in the "uncore"
(L3 cache, on package devices, etc.), or used by memory or I/O devices.
