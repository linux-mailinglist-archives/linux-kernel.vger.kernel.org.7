The mechanism is also there for us to discover the cache sizes without
requiring any devicetree involvement.

Very often the release cycle for the devicetree is tied to the bootloader.
So they may not be updated very often.

Say you have a program that works on batches of data. You may want to
adjust the size of the batch to fit in the L1 (or L2) cache. One way to
do this is to benchmark various batch sizes and select an appropriate
size. But it would be more convenient to the user to pick a batch size
automatically without having to run a benchmark, just by reading from
sysfs.

I'm not sure how well that will improve adoption. Do people even run
kselftest during board bringup?
