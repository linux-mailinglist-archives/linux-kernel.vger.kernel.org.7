What do you mean by GPIO? Maybe we are talking about the very same
thing. From my understanding there are two "parties" involved here:

(1) the linux driver
(2) the bridge IC that comes out of reset when EN is asserted

And both are trying to write to the same setting.

From what I understand, is that (2) is running some kind of state
machine or even firmware that will figure out if there is a refclk
present. If so it will sample the GPIOs and set the refclk frequency
setting accordingly. This happens autonomously after EN is asserted.

Now there is also (1) which will assert the EN signal and shortly
after trying to write the refclk frequency setting.

With this patch we will delay the register write from (1) to a point
after (2) updated its refclk setting. Thus (1) will win.

I'd expect that in this case the refclk is set according to the GPIO
strapping. Correct?

Does it work with the property still in the device tree? I might try
that on my board later.

Unfortunately, the datasheet is really sparse on details here, but
maybe the bridge needs some time after EN is assert to respond on
the I2C bus in general. I'm basing my guesswork on the td5 timing
with the vague description "GPIO[3:1] stable after EN assertion". I
assume that somewhere during that time the chip will sample the
GPIOs and do something with that setting (presumable setting its
internal refclk frequency setting). FWIW there is also a td4
("GPIO[3:1] stable before EN assertion"). Both td4 and td5, makes
me believe that this is not some setting which is sampled (and hold)
at reset, otherwise td5 wouldn't make much sense.
