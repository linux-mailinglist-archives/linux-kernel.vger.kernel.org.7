Ack yes as discussed elsewhere.

However again, as discussed elsewhere, you are setting the MMF and VMA
flags without accounting for the logic in hugepage_madvise().

It being discussed in the other series doesn't mean we can no longer
discuss it :)

I have a big problem with us fundamentally changing a core mm data
structure for what appear to be very specific purposes, yes.

But I think we have a better solution... see below

I'm a maintainer also good sir :)

As I say elsewhere, we could make a pre-requisite change of making
mm->flags 64-bit even on 32-bit kernels.

This is a change that I will be doing to vma->vm_flags soon as I have the
exact same problem, and it's very silly indeed.

Adding 8 bytes per process for every single process everywhere just for
this to suit essentially deprecated kernels is... not ideal :)

But also there's further issues with having 2 flags fields, I discuss
elsewhere in this semi-stream-of-consciousness..

They don't build, at all. I explain how you can attempt a build below.

And no, KSM doesn't break the tests, because steps were taken to make them
not break the tests :) I mean it's really easy - it's just adding some
trivial stubs.

If you need help with it just ping me in whatever way helps and I can help!

It's understandable as it's not necessarily clear this is a thing (maybe we
need self tests to build it, but that might break CI setups so unclear).

The merging is much more important!

I disagree with this asssessment, that doesn't look like consensus at all,
I think at least this is a very contentious or at least _complicated_ topic
that we need to really dig into.

So in my view - it's this kind of situation that warrants an RFC until
there's some stabilisation and agreement on a way forward.

As stated there, you've not explained why alternatives are unworkable, I
think we need this!

Sort of:

1. Why not cgroups? blah blah blah
2. Why not process_madvise()? blah blah blah
3. Why not bpf? blah blah blah
4. Why not <something I've not thought of>? blah blah blah

This patch is only allowing the setting of this flag. I am asking 'so you
can only set this flag?'

To which it appears the answer is, yes I think :)

An improved cover letter could say something like:

"
Here we implement the first flag intended to allow the _overriding_ of huge
page policy to ensure that, when
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled is set to madvise, we are able
to maintain fine-grained control of individual processes, including any
fork/exec'd, by setting this flag.

In subsequent commits, we intend to permit further such control.

You still need to improve the cover letter here I think, see above for a
suggestion!

No :) I understood why you did this though of course.

I'm going to presume you are including me in this category rather than
implying that you are deferring only to others :)

So, there's another option:

Have a prerequisite series that makes mm_struct->flags 64-bit on 32-bit
kernels, which solves this problem everywhere and avoids us wasting a bunch
of memory for a very specific usecase, splitting flag state across 2 fields
(which are no longer atomic as a whole of course), adding confusion,
possibly subtly breaking anywhere that assumes mm->flags completely
describes mm-granularity flag state etc.

The RoI here is not looking good, otherwise.

Yeah I mean it's a mess man, and it's not your fault... Again naming is
hard, I put a suggestion in reply to cover letter anyway...

OK, but please don't, I don't see why this is necessary. if (truthy) is
fine.

Unless somebody has a really good reason why this is necessary, it's just
ugly ceremony.

Well, the issue I guess is... if the flags field is atomic, and we know
over this call maybe we can rely on mm sticking around, then we probalby
don't need an mmap lock actually.

Oh I just noticed - this is really broken - you're not unlocking the mmap()

Checkpatch actually complains the other way :P it doesn't understand
macros.

So you'll start getting a warning here, which you can ignore. It sucks, but
there we go. Making checkpatch.pl understand that would be a pain, probs.

Thanks!

Yeah, again ack, but I kind of hate that we set VM_HUGEPAGE everywhere even
if the policy is never.

And we now get into realms of:

'Hey I set prctl() to make everything huge pages, and PR_GET_THP_POLICY
says I've set that, but nothing is huge? BUG???'

Of course then you get into - if somebody sets it to never, do we go around
and remove VM_HUGEPAGE and this MMF_ flag?

It not only helps, it's utterly critical :)

'It's only called in xxx()' is famous last words for a programmer, because
later somebody (maybe even your good self) calls it from somewhere else
and... we've all been there...

Yes, but as I said there, it's not acceptable, at all.

You're making it so litearlly VMA merging _does not happen at all_. That's
unacceptable and might even break some workloads.

You'll certainly cause very big kernel metadata usage.

Consider:

|-----------------------------|..................|
| some VMA flags, VM_HUGEPAGE | proposed new VMA |
|-----------------------------|..................|

Now, because you set VM_HUGEPAGE _after any merge is attempted_, this will
_always_ be fragmented, forever.

That's just not... acceptable.

The fact KSM is broken this way doesn't make that OK.

Especially on brk(), which now will _always_ allocate new VMAs for every
brk() expansion which doesn't seem very efficient.

It may also majorly degrade performance.

That makes me think we need some perf testing for this ideally...

That doesn't make it ok. Just because KSM is broken doesn't make this ok. I
mean grr at KSM :) I'm going to look into that and see about
investigating/fixing that behaviour.

obviously I can't accept anything that will fundamentally break VMA
merging.

The answer really is to do this earlier, but you risk a driver overriding
it, but that's OK I think (I don't even think any in-tree ones do actually
_anywhere_ - and yes I was literally reading through _every single_ .mmap()
callback lately because I am quite obviously insane ;)

Again I can help with this.
