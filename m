Ok, that makes sense to me, but why can't this be changed? I don't see how the
uAPI would be affected, this is just an implementation detail, no?

Can't you just instead create the VMAs, which hold a reference to the VM_BO,
which holds a reference to the BO, then drop the drop the original BO reference
and finally, when everything is completed, remove all VMAs of the VM_BO?

This should do exactly the same *and* be conformant with GPUVM design.

Again, how is this important for maintaining backwards compatibility with the
uAPI? This all seems like a driver internal implementation detail to me.

So, is there a technical reason, or is it more that it would be more effort on
the driver end to rework things accordingly?
