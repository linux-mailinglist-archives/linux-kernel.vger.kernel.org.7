Until recently the linear map was always PTE-mapped on arm64 if
rodata=full (default) or in other situations (e.g. DEBUG_PAGEALLOC), so
that it never needed to be split at runtime. Since [1b] landed though,
there is support for setting permissions at the block level and
splitting, meaning that the linear map can be block-mapped in most cases
(see force_pte_mapping() in patch 3 for details). This is only enabled
on systems with the BBML2_NOABORT feature though.

It seems to be exactly the situation yes. Given Will's feedback, I'll
try to implement such a dedicated allocator one more time (based on the
scheme I suggested above) and see how it goes. Hopefully that will
create more momentum for a generic infrastructure :) - Kevin
