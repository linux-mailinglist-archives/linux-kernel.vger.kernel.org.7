Yes. Removing extra copy is a goal that can only make sense!

This makes more sense. Maybe we could name them as buf_size and
cmd_len to further make dead obvious the use and purpose.

I just want to get this done right if it is done at all, so here's
one more suggestion:

1. Add TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SYNC
2. Update send() parameters.

You don't have to do anything smart with the new parameter other than
add it to leaf drivers. It makes the first patch bit more involved but
this way we end up keeping the callback interface as simple as it was.

I'm also thinking that for async case do we actually need all those
complicated masks etc. or could we simplify that side but it is 
definitely out-of-scope for this patch set (no need to worry about
this).
