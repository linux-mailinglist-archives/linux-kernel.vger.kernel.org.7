For clarity, that's literally the v6.6 tag from 2023, not a recent
stable v6.6.y tag.

That also doesn't match the commit ID in the bug report linked below,
where the kernel reports itself as:

   6.6.30-android15-8-4k #1 dc911bbdaa9a863c41e12d277ee63ecb446e0526

... which implies that the kernel you're using is derived from the
v6.6.30 stable tag, i.e. commit:

  5697d159afef8c475f13a0b7b85f09bd4578106c (tag v6.6.30)

... in the upstream stable tree.

The commit ID reported by the kernel in the linked bug report, i.e:

  dc911bbdaa9a863c41e12d277ee63ecb446e0526

... does not match anything in this tree, and the latest commits in that
branch are based on v6.6.87.

Is that a kernel you've built yourself, or something shipped by the
hardware vendor?

I suspect that this is whatever the vendor shipped, and you've guessed
as to what exactly it's built from?

Looking at this and the report, I believe that you're running an old
kernel, and hitting an issue which has already has a fix upstream, where
that fix has already been backported to stable trees and the
android15-6.6 branch.

Specifically, I believe you're hitting the issue fixed by upstream
commit:

  751ecf6afd65 ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

... which was backported to the v6.6.y stable branch as commit:

  51d11ea0250d ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

... landing in v6.6.61:

  f1ab3a1bcbbc (tag v6.6.61)

... which was merged into the android15-6.6 branch in commit:

  cf775c9332b1 ("Merge 6.6.61 into android15-6.6-lts")

... back in November 2024.

Mark.
