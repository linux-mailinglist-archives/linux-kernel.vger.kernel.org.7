The point is, IDs represent interrupt IDs. We allocate them in batches,
whose length varies, it can be 1 but it can also be a larger vector
(ie 1024).

It is obviously faster to allocate a range than allocating them 1 by 1,
that's the only reason why we have not used an IDA (and also because I
did not know whether an IDA is recommended for a larger ID space > than,
say, 2^16 - but I think it is because it is designed to cover 0..INT_MAX
and I noticed that -mm folks may even ask to extend it).

We used the maple tree because it handles ranges, we have not found a
sound usage for the 8 byte entry pointer (there may be some but it is
overengineering), that's why I try to merge adjacent ranges on
allocation, for vectors that are length 1 or 2 it is gross to waste
8 bytes for nothing.

Using an IDA and allocating 1 by 1 has its advantages (ie if the ID
space is fragmented it is easier to find free IDs - even though,
again, given the expected allocation pattern, freeing IRQ IDs is rarer
than allocating them so I am not sure we would end up having a very
sparse ID space).

All in all, other than looking sloppy (allocating 1 by 1 when we could
allocate a range), using an IDA would work.

In terms of memory space efficiency, I think this depends on allocation
patterns (and what I did minimise wasting slot entries for nothing).

I added Alexei because, memory allocation notwithstanding, handling
ranges is what the BPF range tree does:

commit b795379757eb

the reason a range tree was implemented to replace a MT was the
memory allocation requirements - they were using a maple tree before
(with unused entries).

I can go for an IDA unless someone see a point in pursuing the current
approach - that I would update according to feedback, at least with
this thread you get the full picture.

Thanks !
Lorenzo
