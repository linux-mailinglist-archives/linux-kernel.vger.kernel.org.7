This seems like the right choice to me :)

Thanks a lot for spending time looking into this, and sorry for the
delayed resposne (I am technically on leave right now).

What do you mean by 'remove the page mapping'? Do you mean
__remove_mapping()?

This is already called by reclaim, so I assume vmscan code hands over
ownership of the page to zswap and doesn't call __remove_mapping(), so
you end up doing that in zswap instead.

Hmm how is this worse than the status quo though? IIUC currently
incompressible pages will skip zswap and go to the backing swapfile.
Surely reading them from disk is slower than copying them?

Unless of course, writeback is disabled, in which case these pages are
not being reclaimed at all today. In this case, it makes sense that
reclaiming them makes accessing them slower, even if we don't actually
need to decompress them.

I have a few thoughts in mind:

- As Nhat said, if we can keep the pages in the swapcache, we can avoid
  making a new allocation and copying the page. We'd need to move it
  back from zswap LRUs to the reclaim LRUs though.

- One advantage of keeping incompressible pages in zswap is preserving
  LRU ordering. IOW, if some compressible pages go to zswap first (old),
  then some incompressible pages (new), then the old compressible pages
  should go to disk via writeback first. Otherwise, accessing the hotter
  incompressible pages will be slower than accessing the colder
  compressible pages. This happens today because incompressible pages go
  straight to disk.

  The above will only materialize for a workload that has writeback
  enabled and a mixture of both incompressible and compressible
  workingset.

  The other advantage, as you mention below, is preventing repeatedly
  sending incompressible pages to zswap when writeback is disabled, but
  that could be offset by the extra cost of allocations/copying.

- The above being said, we should not regress workloads that have
  writeback disabled, so we either need to keep the pages in the
  swapcache to avoid the extra allocations/copies -- or avoid storing
  the pages in zswap completely if writeback is disabled. If writeback
  is disabled and the page is incompressible, we could probably just put
  it in the unevictable LRU because that's what it really is. We'd need
  to make sure we remove it when it becomes compressible again. The
  first approach is probably simpler.
