When we want to map it to user space, which was added in 6.10. Before
that struct page was hardly used.

I'M NOT LYING, and honestly I'm quite offended that you accused me of
lying!

I make it a point to point out very clearly what I'm doing and have
never tried to sneak something past you. That's why our arguments have
been from the cover letter and not the patches themselves.

Before 6.10 (from 2.6.28 through to 6.9), the only uses of struct page
was in the allocation and freeing of the ring buffer. It wasn't used
before that. The virtual address is what the kernel writes to, it's
what was read.

We just started allowing the ring buffer to be memory mapped by user
space in 6.10. But that's not even the main way the buffer is read.
Most of the time, the buffer is read by the "trace" file and that is
where the kernel translates the buffer into human readable text. That
most definitely doesn't need the struct page.

Note, in the splice case, the tracing code does convert it back to a
struct page. But if you do splice on a memory mapped buffer, the ring
buffer code allocates a new page and copies it, as the memory mapped
buffer can not be passed to splice as that requires giving up ownership.

But when you read the "trace" or "trace_pipe" file, or even read the
"trace_pipe_raw", the struct page is never used.

Well, it wasn't that I thought it was hackery, it was that it feels like
you are looking for anything to yell at me for at every pull request I
do. And this one I figured you would find something with.

Because I didn't feel it was as hackery as you do. I'm not even doing
this work alone. I even talk with the memory management folks. They are
not telling me it's hackery.

I'm sorry that you feel this way, perhaps I should quit and find
another profession :-p
