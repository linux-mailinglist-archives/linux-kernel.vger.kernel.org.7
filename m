We do not read cover letters, except when looking for changelogs.

This patch must stand on its own.

So you miss some wiring to the MCU?

Maybe that's your hardware characteristic which you want to encode in
DT. Don't focus on registers, focus on how the hardware or entire system
is done or different.
