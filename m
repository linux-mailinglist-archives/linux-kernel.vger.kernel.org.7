Now that the bridges get pre-enabled before the CRTC is enabled, and get
post-disabled after the CRTC is disabled, update the function
descriptions to accurately reflect the updated scenario.

The enable sequence for the display pipeline looks like:

	bridge[n]_pre_enable
	...
	bridge[1]_pre_enable

	crtc_enable
	encoder_enable

	bridge[1]_enable
	...
	bridge[n]_enable

And, the disable sequence for the display pipeline looks like:

	bridge[n]_disable
	...
	bridge[1]_disable

	encoder_disable
	crtc_disable

	bridge[1]_post_disable
	...
	bridge[n]_post_disable
