Yes, but there are actually two problems with this. The initial pmd that
is created with pfn_pmd() is already not leaf/large, but present, so
pmd_pfn() would already not work correctly on s390.

Later, after the __pmd_to_swp_entry() / __swp_entry_to_pmd() cycle, the
present bit got removed because of how those helpers will be implemented
for s390. Now it is neither large nor present, and pmd_pfn() will be
extra confused.

IOW, even if we could implement those helpers as simple no-ops similar
to other archs, the check would still not work, even though the PMD would
have the present bit set, but it still wouldn't be leaf/large.

I guess my description was a bit confusing, since the !pmd_present()
case would only show on s390, but it is not the only problem here.
I think the point is that those helpers should only be used on "proper"
swap PTE/PMD entries, which already cannot be present. And of course
that pte/pmd_pfn() is not meant to be used on such entries at all, as
David explained.

Yes, but this logic is not really testing swap entries. It only works
because on other archs the __pmd_to_swp_entry() / __swp_entry_to_pmd() are
no-ops, and because pmd_pfn() does not care about leaf/large.

Correct, but with the extra quirk that the initial PMD created by pfn_pmd()
is not leaf/large, which is apparently not a problem on other archs for
the pmd_pfn() conversion.

Actually, I now wonder why pfn_pmd() would not implicitly mark it as
leaf/large already, as it seems that this should only be used for leaf
PMDs. But maybe there are some special cases where it could also be
used for non-leaf PMDs.

As explained above, the initial PMD created by pfn_pmd() is not leaf/large.
Well, conceptually it is more or less, but it is not marked as such. This
would lead to incorrect pmd_pfn() result (only) on s390.
