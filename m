Most of the branches related to 6.18 tree should be already closed (and
were almost closed for the last week or two, depending on the
subsystem). 6.17 was released several hours ago, which means we are now
in the merge window towards 6.18.

No need to, most of the patches will be reviewed. But the ship for 6.18
has already sailed. 6.19 is the earliest merge target.

Note, you have been asked to explain the details regarding IP block
compatibility, rather than just marketing details regarding the
platform. A proper commit message might say something like 'Block foo on
Kaapanali is compatible with the same block on the MSM8960, use
qcom,msm8960-foo as a fallback compatible string'. Or 'Block foo on
Kaanapali has different register stride between ADC channels, as such it
requires a new compatible string'.

2c from my side: please work on declaring the _actual_ dependencies for
the series (as in 'patches in the series won't even build without
changes a, b, c). Use b4 --edit-deps to declare those dependencies.
Remove unnecessary dependencies between DT bindings (by using ephemeral
nodes instead of actual platform indices). Drop long lists of
pseudo-dependencies from cover letters. They do more harm than help.
Work with Bjorn and Konrad on how to better structure the DT patches.
Make sure that all your commit messages describe the _reason_ for the
change rather than the patch contents.
