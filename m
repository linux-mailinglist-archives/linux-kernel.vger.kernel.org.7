You need to explicitly pull this into the .rst files somewhere suitable,
otherwise it wont show up in the docs. With that please also check that
the hyperlinks all work.

So the main use-case for this is when the reset domain is bigger than a
single engine, and you don't want to deal with the mess of inventing your
own synchronization primitives.

I'm not exactly clear what hardware scheduling scenario you're thinking of
here that needs an ordered timeout queue that's shared across instances.

Note that an ordered timeout queue for a single scheduler is fairly
pointless, because we only ever have one pending timeout handler (at least
I thought that's how it works).

> + * Furthermore, for drivers with hardware that supports FIRMWARE scheduling,

I'm not sure you need a firmware scheduler to make this useful, just that
firmware scheduler submit rings tend to be one case where this is a good
locking design. I'd put this at the end as a concrete example instead and
explain why (you already have a single submit ringbuffer, parallelism in
the kernel doesn't serve a point aside from making locking more complex).

Uh if you have an ordered wq you deadlock with just one misuse. I'd just
explain that the wq must provide sufficient forward-progress guarantees
for the scheduler, specifically that it's on the dma_fence signalling
critical path and leave the concrete examples for people to figure out
when the design a specific locking scheme.

Same question about linking ...

Might just put a note in the text section below about concurrency design
questions instead of trying to squeeze these in here.
