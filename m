Subject: [PATCH v13 0/3] sched: Restructure task_mm_cid_work for predictability

This patchset moves the task_mm_cid_work to a preemptible and migratable
context. This reduces the impact of this work to the scheduling latency
of real time tasks.
The change makes the recurrence of the task a bit more predictable.

The behaviour causing latency was introduced in commit 223baf9d17f2
("sched: Fix performance regression introduced by mm_cid") which
introduced a task work tied to the scheduler tick.
That approach presents two possible issues:
* the task work runs before returning to user and causes, in fact, a
  scheduling latency (with order of magnitude significant in PREEMPT_RT)
* periodic tasks with short runtime are less likely to run during the
  tick, hence they might not run the task work at all

Patch 1 add support for prev_sum_exec_runtime to the RT, deadline and
sched_ext classes as it is supported by fair, this is required to avoid
calling rseq_preempt on tick if the runtime is below a threshold.

Patch 2 contains the main changes, removing the task_work on the
scheduler tick and using a work_struct scheduled more reliably during
__rseq_handle_notify_resume.

Patch 3 adds a selftest to validate the functionality of the
task_mm_cid_work (i.e. to compact the mm_cids).

Changes since V12:
* Ensure the tick schedules the mm_cid compaction only once for tasks
  executing longer than 100ms (until the scan expires again)
* Execute an rseq_preempt from the tick only after compaction was done
  and the cid assignation changed

Changes since V11:
* Remove variable to make mm_cid_needs_scan more compact
* All patches reviewed

Changes since V10:
* Fix compilation errors with RSEQ and/or MM_CID disabled

Changes since V9:
* Simplify and move checks from task_queue_mm_cid to its call site

Changes since V8 [1]:
* Add support for prev_sum_exec_runtime to RT, deadline and sched_ext
* Avoid rseq_preempt on ticks unless executing for more than 100ms
* Queue the work on the unbound workqueue

Changes since V7:
* Schedule mm_cid compaction and update at every tick too
* mmgrab before scheduling the work

Changes since V6 [2]:
* Switch to a simple work_struct instead of a delayed work
* Schedule the work_struct in __rseq_handle_notify_resume
* Asynchronously disable the work but make sure mm is there while we run
* Remove first patch as merged independently
* Fix commit tag for test

Changes since V5:
* Punctuation

Changes since V4 [3]:
* Fixes on the selftest
    * Polished memory allocation and cleanup
    * Handle the test failure in main

Changes since V3 [4]:
* Fixes on the selftest
    * Minor style issues in comments and indentation
    * Use of perror where possible
    * Add a barrier to align threads execution
    * Improve test failure and error handling

Changes since V2 [5]:
* Change the order of the patches
* Merge patches changing the main delayed_work logic
* Improved self-test to spawn 1 less thread and use the main one instead

Changes since V1 [6]:
* Re-arm the delayed_work at each invocation
* Cancel the work synchronously at mmdrop
* Remove next scan fields and completely rely on the delayed_work
* Shrink mm_cid allocation with nr thread/affinity (Mathieu Desnoyers)
* Add self test
