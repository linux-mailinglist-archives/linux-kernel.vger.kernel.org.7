The contemporary "advanced on chip power savings" really bite in this
scenario. ;-) It was rather suprising to see what can happen.

They definitely apply on an Android phone with fewer cores. There you
would want to reduce the number of wakeups as much as possible to
conserver power so it needs synchronized mode.

That is why my initial thought was to make it dependent on the number of
active processors.

If it is only a few active cores and the system is basically idle then
it is better to have a synchronized tick but if the system has lots of
active processors then the tick should be skewed. So maybe one idea
would be to have a counter of active ticks and skew them if that number
gets too high.

These usually have 1-4 cores. So synchronized is obviously the best.

I think there is work to do here to sync the ticks between host and guest
for further power savings.

Yea lets see what others say on the matter.

Oh the BKL was good. Synchronization was much faster after all and less
complex. I am sure a BKL approach on small systems would still improve
performance.
