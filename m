That would mean co-ordinating the order those get merged in, which is extra work for the
relevant maintainers.

The patch that moves all the code is easy to regenerate as this series doesn't add any new
functions. Ideally any series touching resctrl in the same merge window would also go via
tip - but it would also possible to rebase onto an immutable branch. (needed if
bitmap-for-next also has dependencies/conflicts on these patches)

I think its easier for the tip folk if I rebase onto this once as/when its got all the
needed tags.


Thanks,

James
