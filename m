This issue turned out to be my own pebcak; I'd missed the
dentry_operations that do normalized lookups (to be fair, they were
rather hidden) and I'd just pulled a 14 hour day so was a tad bitchy
about it on the list.

Dentry aliases are fine when they're intended, they're properly
supported by the dcache.

The issue with caching an alias for the un-normalized lookup name is
(as you note) that by permuting the different combinations of upper and
lower case characters in a filename, userspace would be able to create
an unbounded (technically, exponential bound in the length of the
filename) number of aliases, and that's not what we want.

(e.g. d_prune_aliases processes the whole list of aliases for an inode
under a spinlock, so it's an easy way to produce unbounded latencies).

So it sounds like you probably didn't find the dentry_operations for
normalized lookups, same as me.

Have a look at generic_set_sb_d_ops().

The next issue I'm looking at is that the "keep d_ops out of the
fastpath" only works if case sensitivity isn't enabled on the filesystem
as a whole - i.e. if case sensitivity is enabled on even a single
directory, we'll be flagging all the dentries to hit the d_ops methods.

dcache.c doesn't check IS_CASEFOLD(inode) - d_init can probably be used
for this, but we need to be careful when flipping casefolding on and off
on an (empty) directory, there might still be cached negative dentries.

ext4 has a filesystem wide flag for "case sensitive directories are
allowed", so that enables/disables that optimization. But bcachefs
doesn't have that kind of filesystem level flag, and I'm not going to
add one - that sort of "you have to enable this option to have access to
this other option" is a pita for end users.
