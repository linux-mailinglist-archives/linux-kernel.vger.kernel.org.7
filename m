If it fails fsck, don't mount the !@?@# image.  For ext4, we can fix
pretty much any corrption, so using fsck.ext4 -y should work for nearly all
file system images.

Do what?  Tell users that they should be able to mount untrusted file
systems that fail fsck, and after we have a catastrophic security
failure, hope that someone will fund it?  I don't think that's very
responsible.

Or did you mean spamming open source volunteers with syzbot reports
hoping that you can shame/abuse them to do the work for free?  Sorry,
that's not going to work.  It's just way too much of a lift ---
multiple SWE-years worth of work is not something that I'm going to do
after midnight or on weekends.

If you really want to mount file systesms that fail fsck, or you're
too lazy to run fsck on untrusted images (and this shouldn't be hard
to teach the desktop software check the file system automatically
before auto-mounting it), then another possibility is:
