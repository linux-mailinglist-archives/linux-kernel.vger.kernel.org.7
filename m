Probably not -- if care was taken to make sure all callers have an
up-to-date rq->clock (many will have today, some might need updating).
Then its just a matter of saving a copy.

Basically stick assert_clock_updated() in __resched_curr() and make all
the splats go away.

I'm not sure I see the need for this complication -- under the premise
that the duration is strictly limited to less than what syscalls can
already inflict upon us, there should be no observable difference in
worst case timing.

But yes, if this makes some people feel better, then I suppose can look
at this.
