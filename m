If it's about having some dynamic input stream, creating an example with a
platform driver clearly doesn't help by itself.

But that wasn't my understanding. My understanding was that the request is to
show it in a driver context, where you won't get away with statics. :)

But that's maybe because *I* would like to focus more on this case, because it's
the common one.

If that's the request, you could simply create a function that returns a
Vec with some random entries and then you just iterate over it in
Driver::probe() or Module::init()?

I don't know if that case is too interesting, since conceptually it doesn't make
a huge difference to the case where you have a single instance, i.e.

Current
-------

	struct Bar {
	   a: A,
	   b: B,
	}

	// Single.
	struct Foo {
	   bar: Arc<Bar>,
	   bar_file: File,
	}

	// Multiple.
	struct Foo {
	  bars: Vec<Arc<Bar>>
	  bar_files: Vec<File>, // contains a File for each field for every Bar
	}

Proposed (pin-init)
-------------------

	struct Bar {
	   a: File<A>,
	   b: File<B>,
	}

	// Single.
	struct Foo {
	   bar: Bar,
	}

	// Multiple.
	struct Foo {
	   bar: Vec<Bar>
	}
