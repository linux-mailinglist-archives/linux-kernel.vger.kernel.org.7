Ok, I will add a patch to implement that logic in the next version.

When ext4_mb_regular_allocator() fails, it might retry and get called
again. In this scenario, we can't reliably determine if ac_g_ex has
already been modified. Therefore, it might be more appropriate to set
ac_g_ex.fe_start to -1 after ext4_mb_find_by_goal() fails. We can then
skip ext4_mb_find_by_goal() when ac_g_ex.fe_start < 0.
