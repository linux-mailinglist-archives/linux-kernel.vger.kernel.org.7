man setrlimit(2):

  An unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value in the
  range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard
  limit. A privileged process may make arbitrary changes to either limit
  value.

This is a well-documented behavior. But it works in all user namespaces.
If a unprivileged user has rlimits in init_user_ns, they should not be
exceeded even if that process uses a different user namespeces.

So even if you increase rlimits in the new user namespace as root (in the
new userns), it doesn't mean that rlimits in the parent user namespace
cease to apply or should somehow increase. You still have limitations from
the upper user namespace.

I don't see a issue here.

Yes, we probably can, but we need to have a reason to complicate the code.
And we're still talking about a synthetic test.
