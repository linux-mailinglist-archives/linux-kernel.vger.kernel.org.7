No, that's good, I haven't checked to make sure that static functions
properly show up in the documentation in a while, just wanted to make
sure.

Then how are we supposed to be able to review this proposed patch?

Yes, that would be good, we can bikeshed over that before worrying about
how to review any patches.  But, include this patch in a series so that
we can see how it looks together, otherwise it's going to be hard to
determine usage.

Why not actually say the structure name?  Otherwise over time you are
going to have to get very creative describing structures without using
their types.

Yes, you need to define that.  And define if "shall" or "must" should be
used, as some specs like to use vs the other, and some both.  Let's pick
one and be done with it.

But again, why is zero here an issue?  "number of bytes successfully
copied to user space" defines that, otherwise you are asking for someone
to actually start parsing the data for no good reason.

Yes.

"testable behavior" is going to be very hard given that you are
describing an internal-to-the-kernel function.  Good luck!
