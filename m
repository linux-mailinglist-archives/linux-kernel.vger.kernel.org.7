I didn't say your approach wasn't simple.  I said that my approach has 
very low overhead, a lot lower than the existing code, whereas you said 
my approach "has no much difference" from the existing code.

I didn't say pointer manipulation was simpler than a reusable buffer.  I 
said that it was very low overhead, in order to answer your question: 
"Why implements a device level memory pool would have extremely low 
overhead?"

Neither one.
  
However, you have forgotten about one thing: With your patch, each URB 
maintains ownership of a memory area even when the URB is not in use.  
With the existing code, that memory is freed when the URB is not in use, 
and with my approach the memory is shared among URBs.

In this way, your patch will use more memory than the existing code or 
my approach.  The question to answer is which is better: Using more 
memory (your patch) or using more time (the allocations and 
deallocations in the existing code or my approach)?

No, I meant redesigning the entire USB stack.  It would require changing 
all the USB drivers to allocate URBs differently from the way they do 
now.  And changing every HC driver to preallocate the memory it needs to 
perform transfers.  I think you can agree that would be a pretty drastic 
change.

Both.  See my comment above.

It also needs an extra memory area that is allocated the first time the 
URB is used, and is not deallocated until the URB is destroyed.  You 
seem to be ignoring this fact.
