I thought what motivated the buddy watchdog was patches implementing
this approach on Android for ARM that lacked an NMI based hard lockup
detector?
Anyway, while the buddy watchdog is in use by Google servers the
nmi_watchdog file has an actively detrimental effect on that.
Specifically the nmi_watchdog file having the value of "1" disables
certain event groups for certain metrics in the perf tool as it is
assumed there are too few performance counters due to the NMI watchdog
stealing one. We want groups of events so that events are scheduled
together and metrics are more accurate, we don't want groups that fail
to schedule because of a lack of counters.

I think this is misguided. Currently the only use of nmi_watchdog I'm
aware of is by perf where the buddy watchdog's use of it causes issues
(as mentioned above).

We could with perf then having to read from two files rather than one.
Presumably the lack of presence of one file will be sufficient to also
avoid a kernel version check.

Stuff like this happens, check out this thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2025020304-chip-trench-4e56@gregkh/
Imo we shouldn't design in using an actively misleading file name and
incurring extra overhead in perf. Having two files nmi_watchdog and
buddy_watchdog is fine as the latter case currently isn't in
mainstream distro use and people shouldn't care. It also maintains and
correct's perf's behavior when the buddy and not nmi watchdog is in
use.

I don't mind a file that also says what kind of lockup detector is in
use. I'd like the meaning of nmi_watchdog to keep meaning the kernel
stole a perf counter as this is the behavior long assumed by perf
which I think is the majority or only user of the file. I think the
buddy watchdog being controlled by this file is less than intention
revealing.
