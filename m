We actually thought about O_NONBLOCK but the challenge with that is how
would the node controller knows if the underlying kernel has O_NONBLOCK
implying no-reclaim/no-oom-kill feature. I don't think opening
memory.max with O_NONBLOCK will fail today, so the node controller would
still need to implement the complicated fork+set-limit+alarm logic
until the whole fleet has moved away from older kernel. Also I have
checked with systemd folks and they are not happy to implement that
complicated fork+set-limit+alarm logic.
