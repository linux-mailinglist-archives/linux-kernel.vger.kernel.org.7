I'd like to revisit the NUMA-aware swap priority behavior based on
further implementation consideration. After refining the idea 
, I realized there are potential issues
if we fully remove NUMA autobind behavior when cgroup priorities are
set.

For example, suppose the global swap device priorities are configured
as:

  swapA -2
  swapB -3
  swapC -4

If we update the per-cgroup priority of swapA to a positive value, it
feels natural that only swapA should be affected, and swapB/swapC
should remain subject to NUMA autobind as configured globally. In other
words, the presence of one overridden device shouldn't disable autobind
entirely.

Thus, it seems that we may still need to retain some internal structure
for honoring NUMA autobind even when swap cgroup priority is enabled,
at least for the devices not explicitly overridden.

This leaves us with a few design options:

1. Treat negative values as valid priorities. Once any device is
   assigned via `memory.swap.priority`, the NUMA autobind logic is
   entirely disabled.
   - Pros: Simplifies implementation; avoids exposing NUMA autobind via
     cgroup interface.
   - Cons: Overrides autobind for all devices even if only one is set.

2. Continue to treat negative values as NUMA autobind weights, without
   implicit shifting. If a user assigns `-3`, it is stored and used
   exactly as `-3`, and does not affect other devices.
   - Pros: Simple and intuitive; matches current implementation
     semantics.
   - Cons: Autobind semantics still need to be reasoned about when
     using the interface.

3. Disallow setting negative values via `memory.swap.priority`.
   Existing NUMA autobind config is preserved, but no new autobind
   configuration is possible from cgroup interface.
   - Pros: Keeps cgroup interface simple; no autobind manipulation.
   - Cons: Autobind infra remains partially active, increasing code
     complexity.

4. Keep the current design: allow setting negative values to express
   NUMA autobind weights explicitly. Devices without overridden values
   continue to follow NUMA-based dynamic selection.
   - Pros: Preserves current flexibility; gives users control per device.
   - Cons: Slightly more complex semantics; NUMA autobind remains a
     visible part of the interface.

After thinking through these tradeoffs, I'm inclined to think that
preserving the NUMA autobind option might be the better path forward.
What are your thoughts on this?

Thank you again for your helpful feedback.

Best regards,
