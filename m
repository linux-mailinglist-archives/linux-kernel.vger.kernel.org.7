Adding PropertyGuard changes the API. I don't think it makes sense to
review the API without it and then again with it.

It might be reasonable to split adding the fwnode bindings and then
the Device version. But those are in separate files anyway, so it's
not really making review easier.

Please understand maintainers are reviewing 10s to 100s of patches a
week. I don't necessarily remember my own comments from last week.

A commit per method really seems excessive to me. I prefer to look at
the API as a whole, and to do that with separate patches only makes
that harder.

A reasonable split here is possibly splitting the fwnode and the
Device versions of the API. In any case, I think we've discussed this
enough and I don't care to discuss it more, so whatever reasonable
split you come up with is fine with me.

Mailing lists are a good scapegoat, but you can have 2 reviewers with
2 different opinions anywhere. That's just the nature of a large,
distributed project with lots of reviewers.
