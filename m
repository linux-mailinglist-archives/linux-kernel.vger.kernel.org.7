I can remove that line, it might be more appropriate to add in the cover 
letter as it's relating to other commits in this set.

Yes I can mention that it's expected to be and was measured to be 
faster. That should help people running git log in the future to see why 
we did it.

I somewhat disagree with this. Usually maintainers add a 'Link:' to the 
mailing list when applying patches, so the cover letter shouldn't be 
lost. And these particular performance test results are short lived, in 
several years time other things may have changed. The performance is 
related to a specific device and the state of the rest of the kernel at 
this time. Additionally, I mentioned that it's the combination of two 
commits. In order to put figures on this commit message I would have to 
run another set of tests with only this commit and not the one to 
increase the buffer size which comes after. I did consider reversing the 
order of them to do this, but it wasn't straightforward, and I really 
didn't think it was worth the effort when I can just put the figures on 
the cover letter.

We only need the figures to judge whether to merge it right now, readers 
in the future will want to read the commit message to see what was done 
and why. I'm sure that they can trust that we measured some improvement 
if for some reason the cover letter is lost.

It's very common in the kernel to put figures relating to an entire 
patchset on the cover letter of it, rather than on the last commit message.
