FWIW, we are in a little bit of a sticky situation here. We were in a
bit of a bad place from the start because the Linux driver ignored HPD
from the beginning but we didn't actually document that people should
be setting the "no-hpd" property until a little bit later. You can see
some discussion about this in commit 1dbc979172af ("dt-bindings:
drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Document no-hpd") where I noted "this is
somewhat of a backward-incompatible change." ...but, at the time, it
wasn't really a big deal because there were very few users (the one in
tree at the time was cheza, which was a dev board used internally at
Google).

...so, as of that change in May of 2020, it was documented that eDP
users were _supposed_ to be setting NO_HPD. I even remember Bjorn
requesting the "or is otherwise unusable" phrasing because we pretty
much wanted to set this property on everyone using sn65dsi86 as eDP
(even if they have HPD hooked up) because the debouncing time is so
long that it was better to hardcode the max delay instead of reading
the HPD line. Of course, even though we documented that they were
supposed to have the "no-hpd" property didn't necessarily mean that
everyone did. The code has never enforced it. I don't believe it even
checks the property...

So if there are dts files out there that don't set the property and
they were submitted after the bindings change in 2020, _technically_
they've been wrong the whole time. We're not changing history by
adding a new requirement so much as fixing broken DTS files. Although
the Linux driver always allowed them to get away with being broken,
technically DTS is separate from Linux so if they've been violating
the bindings then they've been wrong. :-P That being said, they've
been working and it would be nice to keep them working if we can, but
one could make an argument that maybe it would be OK to require them
to change...

While a bit on the ugly side, it seems like perhaps you could just do this:

1. If enable_comms is called before the bridge probe happens, just go
ahead and disable HPD.

2. When the bridge probe happens, if you notice that HPD should be
enabled and comms are on you can just enable HPD then (grabbing the
comms_mutex while doing it).

3. Any subsequent enable_comms called after the bridge probe happens
shouldn't disable HPD.

...you'd probably want a comment about the fact that "no-hpd" property
is unreliable, which is why we can't figure this out in a better way.
