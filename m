Yes, and the process is that the leaf/bit needs to be in the data base so
that the headers containing the new leaf/bit can be auto generated.

Kinda, but you're conflating things here. leaf_7.la57 is a hardware
property and leaf_linux_$N.la57 is a software property.

Of course you might say, that clearing leaf_7.la57 is sufficient to achieve
this.

But in fact, "clearing" the hardware view is the wrong thing to do from
a conceptual point of view. The hardware view is "cast in stone" no
matter what and having a clear distinction of a separate software view
will make things way more clear and understandable.

I've stared at code for hours just to figure out that there was some
obscure way to end up with a disabled feature bit.

Having a software view in the first place makes it clear that this is
subject to a logical operation of 'hardware capable' _and_ 'software
willing' instead of some hidden and obscure 'pretend that the hardware
is not capable' magic.

Clear conceptual seperation is the only way to keep sanity in this ever
increasing complexity nightmare.

Claiming that saving 5 bits of extra memory is a brilliant idea was
even wrong 30 years ago when all of this madness started.

I freely admit that I was thinking the same way back then, because I was
coming from really memory constraint microcontroller systems. But in the
context of Linux and contemporary hardware complexity we really need to
shift the focus to comprehensible concepts and strict abstractions
between the hardware and software point of view.
