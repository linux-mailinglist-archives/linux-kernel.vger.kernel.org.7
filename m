 I do have a dual i586 with an APIC; used it to work on some NMI watchdog 
stuff that landed in mainline 25+ years ago.  Back in the day such systems 
were pretty common, built around the NX or later the HX chipset, so it's 
not that APIC support is irrelevent could be dropped.  If we were to go 
for a separate port, than stuff could potentially be resurrected too that 
was previously removed, such as discrete i82489DX APIC support.

 NB that box actually still runs some server software I need for my lab 
(MOP daemon, needed to netboot various DEC equipment) that I haven't 
ported to POWER9 owing to higher priority items.

 I suspect eventually we'll want to drop all IA-32 support from mainline; 
isn't it of no commercial relevance already?  Hasn't even the embedded x86 
ecosystem switched to 64-bit Atom and the like?

 Actually I think a project to maintain the whole IA-32 platform alive 
rather than just the i486 subtarget might attract more attention and 
people beyond just myself and Adrian.  So far I've committed to support 
across the board (Linux where applicable and the GNU toolchain) for DEC 
Alpha, MIPS and VAX platforms plus a couple of small pieces such as the 
defxx driver and I can hardly cope already, so taking on another large 
project just won't work if I were alone with it.

 Correct, I just want to keep support to the minimum at the moment.
