Hi Bijan,

I hope you are doing well! Sorry for the late response. It seems like SJ
already gave some great feedback already though, so I will just chime in
with my 2c.

I think the addition of this example helps illustrate the neccesity for
interleaving, thank you for adding it in!

Thank you for sharing these very impressive results! So if I can understand
correctly, this workload allocates once (mostly), and each iteration just
re-uses the same allocation, meaning the effects of the weighted interleave
change are isolated mostly to the migration portion.

Based on that understanding, I'm wondering if a longer benchmark would help
demonstrate the effects of this patch a bit better. That is, IIRC short-lived
workloads should see most of its benefits come from correct allocation,
while longer-lived workloads should see most of its benefits come from
correct migration policies. I don't have a good idea of what the threshold
is for characterizing short vs. long workloads, but I think this could be
another prospective test you can use to demonstrate the gains of your patch.

One last thing that I wanted to note is that it seems like iteration 5, where
I imagine there is some additional work needed to balance the page placement
from 255:0 to 3:1 *still* outperforms the normal case in the original
benchmark. Really awesome!!!

If the goal of 0 weights is to prevent migration to that node, I think that
we should try to re-use existing mechanisms. There was actually quite a bit
of discussion on whether 0 weights should be allowed (the entire converstaion
was split across multiple versions, but I think this is the first instance [1]).

How about using nodemasks instead? I think that they serve a more explicit
purpose of preventing certain nodes from being used. Please let me know if
I'm missing something as to why we cannot use nodemasks here : -) 

[...snip...]

One last thing that I wanted to note -- given that these weights now serve
a dual purpose of setting allocation & migration weights, does it make sense
to update the weighted interleave documentation with this information as well?
Or, since it really only affects DAMON users, should we be ok with leaving it
out?

My preference is that we include it in weighted interleave documentation
(Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-kernel-mm-mempolikcy-weighted-interleave)
so that anyone who edits weighted interleave code in the future will at least
be aware that the changes they make will have effects in other subsystems.

Thank you for sharing these results! I hope you have a great day :):)
