Krzysztof, this sounds a bit like the qcom,controlled-remotely and
qcom,powered-remotely boolean properties we have for the BAM DMA nodes
on Qualcomm platforms, doesn't it? They too, tell the driver to not
enable certain resources as it's the TrustZone that will do it. Maybe
it is a valid use-case for something more generic? And if not, then
something like thead,hlos-controlled for this particular use-case.
