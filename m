I sleep on it a bit both literally and philosophically. I like to
point out that most of the cgroup control is about resource
constraints. For example, if you set a memory limit on the toplevel
cgroup. None of the children can go beyond that limit. So the child
usage does not make sense to go more than the parent usage. This is a
strict mathematical subset containing relationships. That is the
deeper reason behind the parent to child more restrictive pattern,
because mathematically it does not make sense otherwise.

The swap file control is different. What we really want is not about
the source limit. We have swap.max for that. The swap.tiers is about
QoS control. In the QoS point of view, there is not such a strict
subset containing relationships. The QoS of the parent and child can
be independent. Therefore, it is justifiable to have an anti-pattern
here. Because the root cause, the QoS is not a resource limit type of
the constain. It is more like a policy.

We shouldn't adhere to the common behavior just because other cgroup
interfaces do it. Here I believe we have a justifiable reason to break
away from it. Because it is a different type of control, QoS vs limit.

I think you touch on a very important question that might trigger a
big design change. Do we want to have a per tier swap.max? It will
specify not only whether this cgroup will enroll into this tier or
not. It also controls how much swap it allows to do in this cgroup.
The swap.max will follow the straight contain relationship. I would
need to think more about the relationship between swap.max and
swap.tiers. Initial intuition is that, we might end up with both per
tier swap.max, which control resource limit, it has subset contain
relationship. At the same time the swap.tiers which control QoS, it
does not follow the subset contained.

Need more sleep on that.

I am not against it. There might be some small aspect of it here and
there to fine tune.

First of all, sorry about the pedantic, it should be "swap.tiers" just
to be consistent with the rest of the discussion.
Secondly, I just view names as an alias of the number. 1-3 is hard to
read what you want.
If we allow name as the alias, we can also do:
echo zram-hdd > memory.swap.tieres

It is exactly the same thing but much more readable.

2, assuming non-subset is allowed)

echo ssd-network_device,some_device2 > memory.swap.tiers

See, same thing but much more readable what is your intention.

BTW, we should disallow space in tier names.

The number to device mapping is just harder for humans to process. I
think the named alias makes sense. There is an advantage of using bash
to control it from sysfs rather than a dedicated user space swap tiers
control tool. You can still write a user space tool if you want. I
want the userspace tool optional.
It is the same thing under the hook anyway.

I still prefer to use the name myself. I am not against having numbers
if you prefer numbers more. You can configure it with numbers. I have
a small brain and I want to use names as aliases to config.

The name is a huge usability improvement for bare mortals. I don't
want to maintain user space tools just to adjust swap.tiers IMHO. I am
not opposed to someone else having such tools. It needs to be
optional.

I consider that really trivial. Why can't we have both? The madvise
interface might only use numbers in the form of bit mask. Because that
is a C interface. For sysfs and administrative control, having a name
as an alias is so much better.

We do want to think about swap.tiers vs per tier swap.max. One idea
just brainstorming is that we can have an array of
"swap.<tiername>.max".
It is likely we need to have both kinds of interface. Because
"swap.<tiername>.max" specifies the inclusive child limit.
"swap.tiers" specifies this C group swap usage QoS. I might not use
hdd in this cgroup A, but the child cgroup B does. So A's hdd max
can't be zero.

The other idea is to specify a percentage for each tier of the
swap.max in "swap.tiers.max". That in place of "swap.<tiername>.max":
zram:30  sdd:70
That means zram max is "swap.max * 30%"   and ssd max is "swap.max *
70%". The number does not need to add up to 100, but can't be bigger
than 100.
The sum can be bigger than 100.

Need more sleep on it.
