Ahh I missed that the splitting point could be inside of `revoke`.

What are those `pci_iounmap` and `pci_release_region` calls? Ah maybe
they are from a `T` that expects the driver to still be bound when it is
being dropped? That would make a lot of sense.

If I'm correct, do you mind adding the above example execution to the
commit message? Including the information that the type `T` is allowed
to expect that the driver is still bound while being dropped. That would
make it obvious to me what the issue is.

Agreed :)
