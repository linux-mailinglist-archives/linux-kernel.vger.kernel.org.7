Apologies for the delay in following up on this thread. Yes, we can certainly
add the 64-bit FFA_RUN, but we'll need to align with the spec authors first.
I'll follow up internally to ensure there's no conflict between how it's
defined in the spec and how it's used in the kernel.

It looks like the change in the spec is already WIP which I was made aware
just now, so I don't see any issue updating the driver.
