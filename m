But that shouldn't matter? Userspace gives you a BO, the driver creates VMAs
itself, which can have a reference on the VM_BO, which references the original
BO. At this point you can drop the original reference of the BO and just destroy
all corresponding VMAs once the driver fulfilled the request from userspace?

Sure, I get that; what I do not get is why it can't be changed, e.g. in the way
described above.

So, you're saying there is no technical blocker to rework it?
