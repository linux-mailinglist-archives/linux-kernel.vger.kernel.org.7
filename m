Well, I didn't do it on purpose. I think I have an established track
record of asking you first before I intentionally do stupid things with
git (like the recent prefix collision PoC[1] that I privately emailed
you about).

I'm trying to figure it out now. I must have shot myself in the foot
somewhere, since I had a number of "by hand" things going on this week.
My current guess (while AFK) was that something went sideways while
trying to rebase my for-next/hardening vs my for-linus/hardening trees,
since I had, at one point, based my for-next on
9d7a0577c9db35c4cc52db90bc415ea248446472 (1 commit past v6.15-rc3) since
I was still working on -Wunterminated-string-initialization patches.
(Normally I exclusively base on -rc2.) Then I had my SSD failure, but
things seemed okay after that, but then when I built the
for-linus/hardening tree I rebased patches that were on top of for-next
over on to latest "master" because basing it on 1 past rc3 seemed weird.
It was around here that I started having problems.

But like I said, I'll see if I can reproduce it. I have a lot of
scripting to sanity check my pushes, and I (stupidly) overrode them
because normally they get angry when I'm not basing on rc2, etc. But
I've never had anything like this happen.
