Definitely better for performance...

... indeed all of this was initially prototyped under debugfs in

	/sys/kernel/debug/scmi/0/telemetry

The thing is, of course, anything there is doomed to be axed in a
production system....so you would loose the human-readable and easily
scriptable API...while moving to sysfs is probably less of acceptable
for a number of reasons (like multi value files...)

... so for these reasons I would also be tempted by a variation of B:

 - a standlone full-fledged filesystem to overcome sysfs limitations,
   but stripped down a bit to avoid the full-depth of the above sysfs
   tree (say dropping the DEs dedicated subdirectories), and augmented
   with some dedicated file and related IOCTL/file_operations based binary
   interface as described in the current uapi, so as to avoid additional
   dedicated char-devices to cope with

Yes...and  indee  this would be a nice to have, BUT at the moment being SCMI
the one and only user of this new subsystem, I would NOT even have
enough non-SCMI use-cases to look at in order to generalize and abstract
some common features...

Absolutely, but, just to be clear, here I am talking about adding some of
the discovered Telemetry DEs also as additional sensor devices to HWMON,
BUT any existing sensor discovered via the SCMI Sensor protocol (0x15)
which is currently fed into HWMON or IIO will STILL be handled by those
subsystems....

...well the thing is, while you can be sure that a DE is a temperature
you cannot automatically be sure of WHAT it is really measuring (name is
also optional) OR if it fits (or you want it to fit) into HWMON or IIO
subsystems...IOW there are NO well-known/architected DE beside a few
general events in the 0xA000-0xA013 range...

Absolutely, but as of now I think Kernel needs some sort of feedback/config
info from userspace to identify WHAT is fine to be registered with HWMON/IIO/PERF
etc etc...since userspace is where the precise semantic decription of what-the-hell
0x1234 ID represents on the specific platform...
(so that is the reason for still NOT having this mechanism in this series...)

I dont think DT is a viable option for this kind of descriptions...I was
more thinking about an extension of (whatever we choose as) API which
a userspace app can use to select which DEs is approriate for a specific
kernel subsystem (f anything)
