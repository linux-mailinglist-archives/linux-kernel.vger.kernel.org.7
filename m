So if I understand this correctly a Stream ID corresponds to an IOMMU
domain right?

Ok, then in that case I'll keep the driver in its current state without
these implementations if that's ok. Connected with this I wanted to know
your thoughts on the best way to upstream this, is it better to wait for
testing on different platforms first and then if things work merge a
driver that works for all of them or go with Tegra210 first and then add
more platforms later on?

Thanks,
Diogo
