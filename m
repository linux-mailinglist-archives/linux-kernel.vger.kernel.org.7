Ack on all the points you mentioned above.

Also agree on the review below, I made it as draft to check if it would work
properly but need to fix the duplication, abstraction, break and the assert
(I went through all the comments while writing below but missed the assert
one, sorry about that!).

Let me clean up the whole thing with a much better cover letter and send a RFC v3
on Monday.

Thanks again for the quick and really valuable feedback, its looking a lot better
than the current version!

Thanks,
Usama
