The energy telemetry counters implemented in this series have:

	core_energy:	Units are Joules
	activity:	Units are Farads (Dynamic Capicitance or "CDyn")

Each of these is reported by h/w as a fixed-point binary value with 18
binary places. I'm proposing reporing these as floating point decimal
value with six decimal places (since 1/2^18 ~= 0.0000038)
Loss of precision from conversion to decimal is likely far smaller than
the error bars on the estimation of these values).

Sounds like my fixed-point proposal could be useful for these memory
bandwidth values.

Upcoming "region aware" Intel RDT features also present challenges for
backward compatibility as there are going to be separate counters and
controls for each region. Maintaining the use of "percentage" for
controls only gives feeling of familiarity while any tools that are
using the "MB:" line in the schemata file aren't going to work at all.

Sadly, we won't have a direct "MBytes/second" interface (though our
goal is to get to that some day). H/w interface values for throttling
change from legacy 0,10,20,...90 (no throttle up to max) to 255,254...1
(max bandwidth to min).

There's also the bonus feature that memory bandwidth limits can
specify min and max values so hardware can grant jobs some amount
of extra bandwidth when the system is not busy, or throttle just
the low priority jobs when approaching capacity limits.
