I mean, not enabling the tests in production is how it should be.

But Fedora already enabled CRYPTO_SELFTESTS, apparently because of FIPS
(https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark/-/merge_requests/3886).

You're right there doesn't seem to be an up-to-date bug for Debian
(https://bugs.debian.org/599441 is old), so maybe my conclusion is premature.

However, besides FIPS I think the problem is that the crypto/ philosophy is to
throw untested and broken hardware drivers over the wall at users.  As long as
that's the case, the self-tests do actually have some value in protecting users
from those drivers, even though that's not how it should be.
