This is more of a confusing of the words. I did say "that's all the
code cares about", I meant the code that is used for recording and
reporting the events. I thought it was obvious that I didn't mean the
mmapped code. It wasn't lying, it was a miscommunication.

My point was that I can't *just* use the struct page. It sounds to me
that you want me to to refactor all of the code to handle struct page
even when the consumer is in the kernel.

Again, are you suggesting that the code needs to be converted to using
struct page for all of it? Even for the kernel consumer code?

I guess, are you asking to save the struct page for every allocation,
and not using virt_to_page() to get it? In other words, do I need to
increase the memory footprint to add another pointer because the code
can be mmapped?

	page = page_alloc();
	bpage->page = page_address(page);
	bpage->struct_page = page;

??

Because this was the code we last had an argument about, which is why I
figured it would be "controversial". You don't need to read more into
it than that.

Again, it wasn't because I thought it was hackery, but because this is
the code we last argued about. Hence, why I thought it was the most
"controversial".

So you are saying that you want this to save the page struct directly
then. My only concern with that is the added memory to save the
structure when it could be easily calculated.

As I work on memory limited devices, I try not to waste memory when
there's another way to get what is needed.
