After having thought a bit more about it, I actually agree that the
moving of address/size-cells from SoC to board dts[i] should be separate
from extracting the ports/endpoints into a node with a phandle
reference. This patch set is actually from 2 branches:
- dtb-fixes-dsi
- dtb-fixes-ports-endpoints (although I now use 'dtb-fixes-fruit')

ports-endpoints is on top of dsi and came forth as it made sense to do
the ports/endpoints extraction in more places.
I'll then also put the DT node movement in a separate patch.

I'm not a fan of putting clock-master + status property move into a
separate patch as then the address/size patch would look weird (to me)
as you'd see how those properties were inconsistently sorted ... just so
that can be fixed in a separate patch.

Cheers,
  Diederik
