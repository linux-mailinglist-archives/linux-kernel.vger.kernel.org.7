Ah, my tools only spot unused symbols, they're header inlines; I've
not found a way to spot those yet.

i'm very gentle about this; I'm not pushing back hard if someone
says actually they want to keep something.

I'd say my 'claim' is fairly good as even you say
  'I'm not using it but still considering..'

You don't need to push back quite as hard on me!

You could forgive me for thinking this is unused;
  a) There are no callers in the tree - I can't possibly imagine all
   other trees to check; especially those on someones local disk
   or thoughts still bouncing around in your brain!

  b) There's no listed maintainer, so I can't assume anyone is actively
  working on it

  c) The only changes in years in the tree are cleanups, like strcpy
  variants.

We do have other APIs that people care about and aren't in use;
now if those are nicely thought out APIs etc I think that's fine.
(I've had others say they want to keep some because they like them or
they're part of a well thought out API)

Why don't you add a MAINTAINERS section with you added just as a 
reviewer?   That at least gets you told if someone dares to clean it up
in the future!
