The regulators normally are all boot-on, so we normally start with all
of them running. But I'll try to improve the wording overall :-) .

Only when the regulator is not set to always-on, so gets disabled by
runtime-pm. But yes, the npu driver was triggering this quite easily.

enable-ramp-delay is a totally different beast than the ramp-delay.
ramp-delay is needed when changing the running voltage and uses a unit
of "uV/us", so microvolt per microsecond ... where the enable-ramp-delay
is the one for enabling the regulator and uses uS.

in turn with the above paragraph, I should probably check again for the
Radxa, because that variant has the same enable-ramp-delay.

that is scope-creep (rk808 !=3D rk860) ... but I find the idea of trying to
set the enable-ramp-delay as required for the rk860-x interesting :-) .
