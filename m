The folio can be freed outside this function by userfaultfd callers, so I
wonder if it'll crash the kernel if mm sees a folio locked while being freed.

It'll be a complex API from another angle, that we'll need 5-6 APIs just to
implement uffd missing mode.

Meanwhile it'll also already start to introduce those function jumps into
shmem even if one would be enough to decouple it.

As I mentioned above, I'm also not against doing it, but IMHO that does not
need to be done right now [1], as currently it looks to me guest-memfd may
not really need missing mode traps as of now, and I am actually not sure
whether it will.  We may not want to introduce 5-6 APIs with no further
user.  We can also always discuss a proper API when the demand arrives.

If uffd_copy is so concerning to people, there's also another alternative
which is to make vm_uffd_ops only support traps except MISSING.  uffd_copy
is only about missing traps. Then we can drop uffd_copy API, but the API
itself is then broken on its own.

I still feel like we're over-worried on this.  For OOT drivers I never
cared breaking anything.  For in-tree ones, this discussion can really
happen when there's a need to.  And at that time we can also have a look at
the impl using uffd_copy(), maybe it'll not be that bad either.  It seems
to me we don't necessarily need to figure this out right now.  IMHO we can
do it two-steps in worst case.

Thanks,
