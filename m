Thanks for explaining, that makes a lot more sense =F0=9F=98=85 I think I f=
lipped the sign
of `delta`.

However, I still think the documentation is not correct. How is this instea=
d:

  Conditionally forward the timer.

  If the timer expires after `now`, this function does
  nothing and returns 0.

  If the timer expired at or before `now`, this function forwards the timer=
 by `interval`
  until the timer expires after `now` and then returns the number of times
  the timer was forwarded by `interval`.

  This is mainly useful for timer types etc etc ...

Best regards,
Andreas Hindborg
