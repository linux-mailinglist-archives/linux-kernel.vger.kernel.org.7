Ugh, SMM.  Yeah, KVM doesn't propagate DEBUGCTLMSR_FREEZE_IN_SMM to the guest
value.  KVM intercepts reads and writes to DEBUGCTL, so it should be easy enough
to shove the bit in on writes, and drop it on reads.

Agreed.  Easy thing is to use the host's value, so that KVM doesn't need to check
for its existence.  I can't think of anything that would go sideways by freezing
perfmon if the host happens to take an SMI.

Intel only.  I assume/think/hope AMD's Host/Guest Only field in the event selector
effectively hides SMM from the guest.
