Olof is probably referring to support for extensions like Xmipsexectl:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20250724-p8700-pause-v5-0-a6cbbe1c3412@htecgroup.com/

  https://mips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P8700_Programmers_Reference_Manual_Rev1.84_5-31-2025.pdf

Xmipsexectl is annoying for at least two reasons:

1. it is a non-conforming RISC-V extension, stepping on existing 
   standardized base RISC-V ISA opcode space; and

2. it brings over new barrier operations straight from the MIPS
   instruction set, rather than just using the standard RISC-V fences

Doing things like this runs additional ecosystem fragmentation risk, which 
impacts all of us, for little apparent gain.  Nevertheless we took these 
patches because their extension includes a custom PAUSE instruction 
variant, and it's understandable that MIPS might have finalized their 
design before Zihintpause.

I hope Xmipsexectl doesn't survive past P8700, and that we never see 
kernel patches to use those leftover MIPS barrier instructions.

This one isn't a hypothetical example either; see:
