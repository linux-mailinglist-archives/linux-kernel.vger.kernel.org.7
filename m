Ah, I missed that, and yes, we should do that.

Fair enough.  But as this is going to be getting into the "let's make
string copies correct", please add Kees Cook to the discussion as he's
doing a lot of work here on the C side of this.

Ok, fair enough, I had missed the "always put a NULL at the end" which
is a good idea.  And yeah, "implying" the size by the size of the buffer
passed in makes sense in one way, the function signature then does look
odd, I missed that.

So yes, a better name might be good, but again, let's try to sync with
the C side where we can.  We now have C string functions that have an
"implicit" length already in them that is discovered by the compiler at
build time, so following their model is good.
