Hi, Muchun, thanks for the patch.

Symmetry of LRU lists doesn't mean symmetry 'hotness', it's totally
possible that a child's active LRU is colder and should be evicted
first before the parent's inactive LRU (might even be a common
scenario for certain workloads).
This only affects the performance not the correctness though, so not a
big problem.

So will it be easier to just assume dying cgroup's folios are colder?
Simply move them to parent's LRU tail is OK. This will make the logic
appliable for both active/inactive LRU and MGLRU.

I think you do have to iterate through the folios to set or clear
their generation flags if you want to put the folio in the right gen.

MGLRU does similar thing in inc_min_seq. MGLRU uses the gen flags to
defer the actual LRU movement of folios, that's a very important
optimization per my test.

If we just follow the above idea (move them to parent's tail), we can
just keep the folio's tier info untouched here.

For mapped file folios, they will still be promoted upon eviction if
their access bit are set (rmap walk), and MGLRU's table walker might
just promote them just fine.

For unmapped file folios, if we just keep their tier info and add
child's MGLRU tier PID counter back to the parent. Workingset
protection of MGLRU should still work just fine.

How much overhead will it be? Objcj has some extra overhead, and we
have some extra convention for retrieving memcg of a folio now, not
sure if this will have an observable slow down.

I'm still thinking if it be more feasible to just migrate (NOT that
Cgroup V1 migrate, just set the folio's memcg to parent for dying
cgroup and update the memcg charge) and iterate the folios on
reparenting in a worker or something like that. There is already
things like destruction workqueue and offline waitqueue. That way
folios will still just point to a memcg, and seems would avoid a lot
of complexity.
