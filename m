Humm, I am missing something. Does this work in the case of spurious 'ghost' ACPI devices, which is quite common for Intel DSDT?

In this case, each 'ghost' device would be assigned a dev_num during the driver probe, but that dev_num would never be used for enumeration, would it?

Let's assume for the sake of the argument there are 16 ghost devices and only one real device that gets enumerated. How can we guarantee that the real device is enumerated with a dev_num <= 11 (the max number of devices supported on the bus)?

I see the patch add a limit during probe, so now that means the number of ACPI devices MUST be lower than 11. That doesn't sound right to me and could cause some configurations to fail. It's perfectly ok to have ghost devices and no limits on how many our BIOS colleagues decide to list.

Using a dedicated IDA for IRQ mapping looks like a good idea to me, but I don't think you can really use the same IDA for dev_num
