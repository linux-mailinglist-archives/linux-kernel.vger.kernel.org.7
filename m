Yeah, I saw that you CC'ed me; at a first glance that seems relatively
innocuous to me as long as it's only done for kernel mappings where
all the rules are different.

I mean, walk_page_range_novma() being used on user virtual address
space is pretty much a debug-only thing, I don't think it matters if
it has to spend time poking flags in a few thousand VMAs. I guess the
alternative would be to say "ptdump just doesn't show entries between
VMAs, which shouldn't exist in the first place", and change ptdump to
do a normal walk that skips over userspace areas not covered by a VMA.
Maybe that's cleaner.

But FWIW, we already do worse than what I proposed here when
installing MMU notifiers, with mm_take_all_locks().

Because untagged_addr_remote() has a mmap_assert_locked(mm) on x86 and
reads data that is updated under the mmap lock, I think? So without
this change you should get a lockdep splat on x86.

I'm talking about doing this heavyweight locking in places like
arch_prctl(ARCH_ENABLE_TAGGED_ADDR, ...) that can, if I understand
correctly, essentially reconfigure the size of the virtual address
space of a running process from 56-bit to 47-bit at the hardware level
and cause address bits that were previously part of the virtual
address to be ignored. READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() might do the job too,
but then we'll have to keep in mind that two subsequent invocations of
untagged_addr() can translate a userspace-specified virtual address
into two different virtual addresses at the page table level.
