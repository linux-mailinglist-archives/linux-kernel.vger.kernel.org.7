I definitely won't complain if we get a dedicated struct :)

Ah, I had missed the setting in sget_fc() -- you're right, we should get
rid of the one in v9fs_set_super()
(or actually, get rid of v9fs_set_super altogether and pass
set_anon_super() directly to sget_fc())

No worry, I should have re-sent a ping earlier as well.

Alright, I don't think we want to rush this, so let's get this next
