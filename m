It's unfortunate that you've had a torrid time with the Apple PMU driver,
but I think it's important to realise that it's both unmaintained (it
ends up with me via the catch-all for drivers/perf/) and was written
based off whatever reverse-engineering people could be bothered to do in
their spare time. It's frankly remarkable that it works as well as it
does.

Despite all of that, I still don't think that your concerns apply to the
patches in _this_ series, which is about adding support for older Apple
chips.

Easy to say when you don't have to maintain the driver!
