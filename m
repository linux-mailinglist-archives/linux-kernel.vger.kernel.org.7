yes. My bad on that, Sorry about that.

a) is fine with current `status` save/restore on pt_regs on trap frame.

Again I think I missed/confused it in my head when I was trying to ascertain
which `status` will be picked in which situation.

Two questions:

1) In this particular case, there won't be any yielding (kernel induced) between
    `set SUM` and `clear SUM`, right?


2) Will there be nesting of kernel induced events? If not, then I believe current
    patch is good enough. 


If I have to summarize--
- Nesting of `SUM` save/restore across traps is already served by trap entry/exit.
- Kernel induced control flow changes (scheduling) are not allowed between set
   and clear of SUM (and likely future status bits)
- If nesting of kernel induced events dont need to be supported and their
   invocation follow the 2nd rule, then having it in thread_struct makes sense.
   I would ideally call it something else to indicate intentionality.


Let me know if I got it right this time?
