To my understanding, the function is called back only when the parameteer value
is being changed.  Such changes could be made in runtime via parameter files,
and in boot time via the kernel command line.  If there is not kernel command
line for setting the parameter, this callback function is not called.

> so I was wondering under what condition it would not be initialized.

The enabled parameter value is initialized at build time, based on
CONFIG_DAMON_STAT_ENABLED_DEFAULT.  So, the parameter value will always be
initialized.

> I see the comment you wrote above, but was still a little bit confused.

The kernel command line parameters parsing is called in pretty early stage of
the bootup, before slab is ready.  Hence, if enabled parmeter is set by the
kernel command line, damon_stat_enabled_store() is called in the early stage,
and fails from damon_stat_start(), since it needs slab, to initialize DAMON
contexts.  For more details of such failure, you could refer to a previous
issue report[1].

Meanwhile, damon_stat_init() and module init functions are called later, when
slab is ready.  We therefore check the case, and defer real handling of enabled
to damon_stat_init() in the case.

Thank you for this question, I find the comment has rooms to improve.  I'll try
to make this better documented or easier to read.

damon_stat_init() is a module init function, and hence it will be called in
boot time, regardless of enabled parameter setup on kernel command line.  In
other words, it will be always invoked once, with !damon_stat_init_called.  And
it will call damon_stat_start(), unless enabled is unset via
CONFIG_DAMON_STAT_ENABLED_DEFAULT or kernel command line.

So, the current implementation is working as you suggested, to my
understanding.  Please let me know if I'm missing something.

In the kernel command line based parameter setup scenario, later
damon_stat_init() call should see the updated 'enabled' variable value.  Hence,
the user input value check should be done here, regardless of if this is called
before or after damon_stat_init().

So I find no needs to change the code for now.  Nonetheless, I believe this
code has many rooms to improve, and I'm always getting more than glad to get
this kind of improvement ideas.  Thank you, Joshua.  Please feel free to let me
know if you get another idea later.

I hope I answered your questions, but please let me know if I'm missing
something!

You too.  Friday is coming!
