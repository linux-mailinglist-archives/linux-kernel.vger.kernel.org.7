Thanks for clarifying this;

I had which is a pointer and which is embedded wrong on the first
reading so I first wrote that this should be ok if we could just null
the pointer in fs_private to avoid access after the copy, but the
temporary values are the embedded ones we can't "unaccess"...
Hmm, do we need anything else in fs_private after v9fs_apply_options()?
Would it make sense to call v9fs_free_fc() early on and null the full
fs_private in or after v9fs_apply_options()?

Using a different struct tailored for mount options is certainly more
appropriate if you have the time to do it, but as long as the risk of
accessing "the wrong one" goes away I'm fine either way, so if you think
nulling fs_private is possible without too much churn I think that's
good enough.

What do you think?

(Sounds right as nothing else seems to use fc)

My reading is that we need it, because the super block isn't the fs
context, and we need it for v9fs_umount_begin (it doesn't help that the
field name is the same between both structs, and that some super_block
variables are just 's' and others are 'sb', but I think that's the only
place where it's used)

At this point these are both the "real live" v9ses so that should be
fine as far as I can see.

That would be great!

I'm not sure the unsigned makes much different ultimately, but might as
well make it a fsparam_s32 as you suggested...
Now I understand the lifecycle a bit better I can have another read with
that in mind before merging, and we can do the nulling fs_private or
other "make sure this bug doesn't come back" later if you don't have
time, I'm leaving this up to you.

I've never really been sure what kind of tag is appropriate in this
case, but I assume any mention would be welcome :)
