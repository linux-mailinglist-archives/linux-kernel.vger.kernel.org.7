Don't worry too much about other changes, if you don't recall anything 
immediately, there likely isn't anything that significant. If we always
postpone useful reorganizations in fear that some hypothetical work would 
have to rebase, it never gets done :-).

Once I've merged fixes branch into for-next (I should do that at latest 
early next week if not already this week), it should be pretty 
straightforward to handle such move without conflicts.

You should certainly update MAINTAINERS in the same patch to the new 
paths. If you want to make other changes, put them such as add your name 
into some entry or create a generic LENOVO entry, put those into own 
patch after the move please.

Given it's just moves file to new place, the threat of breaking something 
that isn't detected by simple build test, isn't that high.
