The memory is mainly managed from firmwares (mainly openvx layer being used underneath) and there are even non-gstreamer pure openvx based use-cases/tests which use these carveouts. At the end of the day, the firmwares from the only SDK which is released publicly for AM62A uses all these carveouts.

These are programmable cores, you can run whatever you want on them. You can
make your own firmware if you like, we have support for them in our MCU+(FreeRTOS)
offering today[0](look at all these firmware you can build/run!).

In a week or so I'll start pushing support for these cores into Zephyr,
bringing in even more firmware options for these cores.

I simply do not see why one firmware, shipped with one of our SDKs*, doing
things wrong should force us to hack up our DT here in upstream Linux.

*Speaking of the "only" SDK's firmware, if you take our Yocto meta-ti layer and
build an SDK yourself, you get firmware by default that *doesn't need extra
carveouts*! [1][2]

Moreover I don't see any point of adding only half the regions as that would anyway not work with SDK supplied firmwares, for e.g. RTOS-to-RTOS ipc test run by firmwares on bootup would fail, along with other camera+ISP and AI use-cases.
