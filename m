For now, yes. Though, I expect multiple endpoints to become a thing in future
iterations of MediaTek SoCs, and this is based off how the hardware seems to
be evolving.

Like this, yes - but if you consider ipi_id as the endpoint things will change.

Alternatively, if you consider the endpoint as function running on the remote
processor as you propose, and that I think could be the better alternative,
I still expect functions to grow in future SoCs.

I have doubts about that: all this is not properly documented and a kind of
service announcement could actually be existing - but let's assume that it
does not as that's the right thing to do.

There's still a way around that anyway, and even though it's not the prettiest
thing on Earth, it's not a big deal imo.

I'm not sure I understand this sentence, but it feels like this can be avoided
by simply using a cell in devicetree.

rpmsg = <&something 1 0>;  or  rpmsg = <&something 0>;

Heh, if I recall correctly, I did see some userspace messaging in one of the
downstream kernels for other chips that are heavily using the IPI - check below
for a model hint :-)

Weird... it's weird, agreed - but I call that necessary evil.
The other way around could be worse (note: that statement is purely by heart and
general knowledge around MediaTek SoCs, not about any specific code in particular).

I think I do understand your thinking here - and I am not *strongly* disagreeing,
but I don't really agree for the reasons that I'm explaining in this reply.

Now that's what I'd really like to see here, because I feel like many things around
MediaTek SoCs are suboptimally engineered (in the software sense, because in the HW
sense I really do like them) and the *primary* reason for this is exactly the lack
of documentation... -> even internally <-.

The implementation issue arising with a virtual mailbox driver is that then each
driver for each IP (thermal, ccu, vcp, slbc, this and that) will contain a direct
copy of the same part-two implementation for IPI communication: this can especially
be seen on downstream kernels for MediaTek Dimensity 9xxx smartphone chips.

If done with a mailbox, there's going to be no way around it - describing it all
will be very long, so I am not doing that right now in this reply, but I invite
you to check the MT6989 kernel to understand what I'm talking about :-)
