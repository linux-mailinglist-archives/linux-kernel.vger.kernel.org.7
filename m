I don't think Dev's series is mandatory prerequisite for my patches. 
IIUC how the split primitive keeps block mapping if it is fully 
contained is independent from how to apply the permissions change on it.
The new spin implemented keeping block mapping if it is fully contained 
as we discussed earlier. I'm supposed Dev's series just need to check 
whether the mapping is block or not when applying permission change.

The flow just looks like as below conceptually:

split_mapping(start, end)
apply_permission_change(start, end)

The split_mapping() guarantees keep block mapping if it is fully 
contained in the range between start and end, this is my series's 
responsibility. I know the current code calls apply_to_page_range() to 
apply permission change and it just does it on PTE basis. So IIUC Dev's 
series will modify it or provide a new API, then 
__change_memory_common() will call it to change permission. There should 
be some overlap between mine and Dev's, but I don't see strong dependency.

OK, I don't remember we discussed this problem before. I think we can do 
something like what kpti does. When creating the linear map we know how 
many PUD and PMD mappings are created, we can record the number, it will 
tell how many pages we need for repainting the linear map.

I think the only missing part is preallocating page tables for 
repainting. I will add this, then post the new spin to the mailing list.
