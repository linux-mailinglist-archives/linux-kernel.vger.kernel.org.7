Thank you for kindly sharing these!  And I agree the devices could still be
actively used and wouldn't be replaced in the short term.  I believe making
DAMON supports those devices is really important.

DAMON aims to support multiple address spaces that not limited to only virtual
address spaces and physical address space but any imaginable case.  I hence
prefer keeping DAMON core layer independent of the underlying hardware as much
as possible.  I therefore still hope to continue using 'unsigned long'.

Of course, 'unsigned long' wouldn't fit all cases.  32-bit ARM with LPAE is a
great real example, and there might be crazy future use case.  In other words,
this could be identified as an issue of the operations set layer, which
directly deals with the given address space.

I think another approach for this issue is adding a DAMON parameter, say,
address_unit.  It will represent the factor value that need to be multiplied to
DAMON-address to get real address on the given address space.  For example, if
address_unit is 10 and the user sets DAMON monitoring target address range as
200-300, it means user wants DAMON to monitor address range 2000-3000 of the
given address space.  The default value of the parameter would be 1, so that
old users show no change.  32bit ARM with LPAE users would need to explicitly
set the parameter but I believe that shouldn't be a big issue?

What do you think about the rough idea, Ze?  If you don't mind, I could
implement the idea on my own and get your review/tests, or help you
implementing it on your own.  I don't care who implements it but eagerly want
to make DAMON supports the real use case well.


Thanks,
SJ
