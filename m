No worry, thank you for testing that :)

You're right, and this is an intended change.

Again, this is an intended change.  damon_sz_region() callers should aware this
semantic and updated accordingly, if it could make a real problem otherwise.
If you found such changes required cases that this patch series is missing,
could you please list up?

It has been a while since I wrote this patch series, but at least while writing
it, I didn't find such required changes.  Of course I should missed something,
though.  As I mentioned above, could you please list such changes required
parts that makes problem?  That would be helpful at finding the path forward.

Let's see the list of required additional changes with why those are required
(what problems can happen if such chadnges are not made), and discuss.


Thanks,
SJ
