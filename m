Good point!
I agree with the mention that self-partitioned clusters and duplicated priority.
One concern is the cost of synchronization.
Specifically the one incurred when accessing the prioritized swap device
From a simple performance perspective, a per-cgroup-per-CPU implementation
seems favorable - in line with the current swap allocation fastpath.

It seems most reasonable to carefully compare the pros and cons of the           
tow approaches.

To summaraize,

Option 1. per-cgroup-per-cpu
Pros: upstream fit. performance. 
Cons: duplicate priority(some memory structure consumtion cost), 
self partioned cluster 

Option 2. per-cpu-per-order(per-device)
Pros: Cons of Option1
Cons: Pros of Option1

It's not easy to draw a definitive conclusion right away, 
I should also evaluate other pros and cons that may arise during actual 
implementation.
so I'd like to take some time to review things in more detail 
and share my thoughs and conclusions in the next patch series.

What do you think, Nhat and Kairui?
