I guess so.

That's up to Steve. But isn't it just a matter of removing the
if statement that checks for posix?

I think I understand what it tries to do, thanks for explaining.

I was just wondering why the rename on a busy handle would work
while delete won't work. I'd guess the chances are high that both fail.

Do you have network captures showing the old and new behavior
that's often easier to understand than looking at patches alone.
