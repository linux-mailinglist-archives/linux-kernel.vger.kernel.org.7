These carveouts are specific to remote-cores and so have to match with 
firmwares running in these remote-cores. The debate is on which 
firmwares it should match to. The firmwares being packaged in SDK are 
the most used-ones and so in my view it is safe to account them as the 
official ones, unless of-course there is a major overhaul and 
re-architecture planned and accepted for these firmwares in which case 
we should wait for it.

I don't see any changes done in memory map for last set of releases, but 
agreed if there is big architecture change planned for these firmwares 
then we should rather wait for updated firmwares then adding bloated 
carve-outs.

Maybe some optimizations would be missing, but carve-outs for lot of 
things which these firm-wares do out-of-box (and not even related fully 
to AI) are missing. For e.g. there is RTOS-to-RTOS IPC test which runs 
on startup and there is no reserved region for same, this would lead to 
tricky failures. The DM R5 remote core also controls ISP, but all 
required regions for same are also not present either.

There is no apples-to-apples comparison with TDA4VM, unlike AM62A7 it 
offers SDK for both edgeAI and generic Linux [1], so if someone just 
uses latest upstream kernel and device-tree with this generic linux SDK, 
that would still work without any overlays applied or carveouts added. 
Same is not true for AM62A, as AM62A offers only edgeAI SDK with 
firmwares packaged for AI use-cases. So if someone, just replaces latest 
upstream kernel and device-tree with the patches from this series in 
edgeAI wic image, it won't work cleanly due to missing carve-outs.

Also even if we keep aside edgeAI, basic camera+ISP use-case won't work 
without the carveouts and we would prefer not to clone another layer to 
grab the overlay and apply it every-time we want to test run camera+ISP 
(and even the edgeAI use-case) on AM62A which would be a pain.

I understand this, but my view is that w.r.t firmware only goal should 
not just be tp demonstrate correct way of requesting resources from 
resource-tables, optimize the carve-outs etc but also to demonstrate the 
primary use-cases (camera+ISP+edgeAI) which the device is capable of.

I understand this, but will this zephyr based firmware support vision + 
edgeAI analytics ? Does it demonstrate all the unique capabilities of 
AM62A SoC ? If not, then what would be utility of such firmware on AM62A 
where these are the primary use-cases w.r.t AM62A ?

Why should upstream device-tree use carve-outs which match to this demo 
zephyr based firmware (which apparently not many are using and is not 
going into any official SDK release) instead of official firmwares going 
into SDK ? SDK released firmwares are being used by so many customers 
and SDK documentation maps to it, but zephyr firmware that is being 
pitched here, who would be the potential users and what would be it's 
utility ?
