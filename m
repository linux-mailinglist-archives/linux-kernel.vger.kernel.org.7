Hi Alex,
  I'm good with this version, but would wait a few more days for
people to comment before taking them..

Hi Philipp,
  Since these reset patches [3, 4, 6] are sitting on top of clk driver,
I'd assume you're ok with taking them through clk tree? I'd plan to queue
them for 6.16.. if yes, would you be able to give an ACK? I'd appreciate!



for the patch series, I'll give my rb
