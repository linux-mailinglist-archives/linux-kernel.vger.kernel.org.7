The Linux drivers for this particular mailbox/clock controller already
work exactly the way you propose. They are split into two devices that
can probe independently.

The problem is outside of the drivers, because fw_devlink in Linux
blocks probing until all resources specified in the device tree nodes
become available. fw_devlink has no knowledge that the mailbox described
by this peculiar device tree node does not actually need the clocks:

	apcs1_mbox: mailbox@b011000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8939-apcs-kpss-global", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0b011000 0x1000>;
		#mbox-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&a53pll_c1>, <&gcc GPLL0_VOTE>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_XO_CLK_SRC>;
		clock-names = "pll", "aux", "ref";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
	};

Without device-specific quirks in fw_devlink, the fact that these clocks
are only used by an unrelated clock controller only becomes clear if we
split the device tree node like I propose in this series:

	apcs1_mbox: mailbox@b011000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8939-apcs-kpss-global", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0b011000 0x1000>;
		#mbox-cells = <1>;

		apcs1_clk: clock-controller {
			clocks = <&a53pll_c1>, <&gcc GPLL0_VOTE>, <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_XO_CLK_SRC>;
			clock-names = "pll", "aux", "ref";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
		};
	};

It is easy to say that the problem is in Linux (and not the DT), but
unless you are suggesting to remove fw_devlink from Linux, or to add
more device-specific quirks to the generic fw_devlink code, I'm only
aware of the following two options to make this work (both already
discussed in this email thread):

 1. post-init-providers (as suggested by Rob):

		post-init-providers = <&a53pll_c1>, <&gcc>, <&rpmcc>;

    To repeat my previous email: IMHO this is a crude workaround for
    this situation. The clock is not really a post-init provider: It's
    not consumed at all by the mailbox and needed immediately to
    initialize the clock controller.

    With this approach, there are no device links created for the
    clocks, so we don't get the proper probe/suspend ordering that
    fw_devlink normally provides.

 2. Split up device tree node (this patch series): With this approach,
    the mailbox can probe early and the clock controller child device
    gets the expected consumer/supplier device links to the clocks. IMHO
    this is the cleanest solution to go for.

@Saravana: Is there any other option that I missed? Or perhaps you have
any other suggestions how we should handle this?

To summarize the series and previous emails, the dependency cycle that
was in msm8939.dtsi before commit d92e9ea2f0f9 ("arm64: dts: qcom:
msm8939: revert use of APCS mbox for RPM") is:

  1. The clock controller inside &apcs1_mbox needs
     clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_XO_CLK_SRC>.
  2. &rpmcc is a child of remoteproc &rpm
  3. remoteproc &rpm needs mboxes = <&apcs1_mbox 8>;

This is not a real dependency cycle, the clocks in the mailbox@ node are
not needed for the mailbox. They are only used and needed for the clock
controller child device that makes use of the same device tree node.

At runtime this cycle currently results in none of the devices probing:

[   13.281637] platform remoteproc: deferred probe pending: qcom-rpm-proc: Failed to register smd-edge
[   13.296257] platform b011000.mailbox: deferred probe pending: platform: supplier b016000.clock not ready
[   13.308397] platform b016000.clock: deferred probe pending: platform: wait for supplier /remoteproc/smd-edge/rpm-requests/clock-controller

Thanks,
Stephan
