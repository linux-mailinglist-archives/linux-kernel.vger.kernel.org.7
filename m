-Extended Attributes
--------------------
-
-Extended attributes (xattrs) are typically stored in a separate data
-block on the disk and referenced from inodes via ``inode.i_file_acl*``.
-The first use of extended attributes seems to have been for storing file
-ACLs and other security data (selinux). With the ``user_xattr`` mount
-option it is possible for users to store extended attributes so long as
-all attribute names begin with “user”; this restriction seems to have
-disappeared as of Linux 3.0.
-
-There are two places where extended attributes can be found. The first
-place is between the end of each inode entry and the beginning of the
-next inode entry. For example, if inode.i_extra_isize = 28 and
-sb.inode_size = 256, then there are 256 - (128 + 28) = 100 bytes
-available for in-inode extended attribute storage. The second place
-where extended attributes can be found is in the block pointed to by
-``inode.i_file_acl``. As of Linux 3.11, it is not possible for this
-block to contain a pointer to a second extended attribute block (or even
-the remaining blocks of a cluster). In theory it is possible for each
-attribute's value to be stored in a separate data block, though as of
-Linux 3.11 the code does not permit this.
-
-Keys are generally assumed to be ASCIIZ strings, whereas values can be
-strings or binary data.
-
-Extended attributes, when stored after the inode, have a header
-``ext4_xattr_ibody_header`` that is 4 bytes long:
-
-.. list-table::
-   :widths: 8 8 24 40
-   :header-rows: 1
-

-     - Type
-     - Name
-     - Description
-   * - 0x0
-     - __le32
-     - h_magic
-     - Magic number for identification, 0xEA020000. This value is set by the
-       Linux driver, though e2fsprogs doesn't seem to check it(?)
-
-The beginning of an extended attribute block is in
-``struct ext4_xattr_header``, which is 32 bytes long:

-     - h_blocks
-     - Number of disk blocks used.
-   * - 0xC
-     - __le32

-     - Hash value of all attributes.
-   * - 0x10
-     - __le32
-     - h_checksum
-     - Checksum of the extended attribute block.
-   * - 0x14
-     - __u32
-     - h_reserved[3]
-     - Zero.
-
-The checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the 64-bit block number
-of the extended attribute block, and the entire block (header +
-entries).
-
-Following the ``struct ext4_xattr_header`` or
-``struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header`` is an array of
-``struct ext4_xattr_entry``; each of these entries is at least 16 bytes
-long. When stored in an external block, the ``struct ext4_xattr_entry``
-entries must be stored in sorted order. The sort order is
-``e_name_index``, then ``e_name_len``, and finally ``e_name``.
-Attributes stored inside an inode do not need be stored in sorted order.

-       this value is relative to the start of the first entry; for a block this
-       value is relative to the start of the block (i.e. the header).
-   * - 0x4
-     - __le32
-     - e_value_inum
-     - The inode where the value is stored. Zero indicates the value is in the
-       same block as this entry. This field is only used if the

-     - Hash value of attribute name and attribute value. The kernel doesn't
-       update the hash for in-inode attributes, so for that case this value
-       must be zero, because e2fsck validates any non-zero hash regardless of
-       where the xattr lives.
-   * - 0x10
-     - char
-     - e_name[e_name_len]
-     - Attribute name. Does not include trailing NULL.
-
-Attribute values can follow the end of the entry table. There appears to
-be a requirement that they be aligned to 4-byte boundaries. The values
-are stored starting at the end of the block and grow towards the
-xattr_header/xattr_entry table. When the two collide, the overflow is
-put into a separate disk block. If the disk block fills up, the
-filesystem returns -ENOSPC.
-
-The first four fields of the ``ext4_xattr_entry`` are set to zero to
-mark the end of the key list.
-
-Attribute Name Indices
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Logically speaking, extended attributes are a series of key=value pairs.
-The keys are assumed to be NULL-terminated strings. To reduce the amount
-of on-disk space that the keys consume, the beginning of the key string
-is matched against the attribute name index. If a match is found, the
-attribute name index field is set, and matching string is removed from
-the key name. Here is a map of name index values to key prefixes:
-
-.. list-table::
-   :widths: 16 64
-   :header-rows: 1
-
-   * - Name Index
-     - Key Prefix
-   * - 0
-     - (no prefix)
-   * - 1
-     - “user.”
-   * - 2
-     - “system.posix_acl_access”
-   * - 3
-     - “system.posix_acl_default”
-   * - 4
-     - “trusted.”
-   * - 6
-     - “security.”
-   * - 7
-     - “system.” (inline_data only?)
-   * - 8
-     - “system.richacl” (SuSE kernels only?)
-
-For example, if the attribute key is “user.fubar”, the attribute name
-index is set to 1 and the “fubar” name is recorded on disk.
-
-POSIX ACLs
-~~~~~~~~~~
-
-POSIX ACLs are stored in a reduced version of the Linux kernel (and
-libacl's) internal ACL format. The key difference is that the version
-number is different (1) and the ``e_id`` field is only stored for named
-user and group ACLs.

-Directory Entries
------------------
-
-In an ext4 filesystem, a directory is more or less a flat file that maps
-an arbitrary byte string (usually ASCII) to an inode number on the
-filesystem. There can be many directory entries across the filesystem
-that reference the same inode number--these are known as hard links, and
-that is why hard links cannot reference files on other filesystems. As
-such, directory entries are found by reading the data block(s)
-associated with a directory file for the particular directory entry that
-is desired.
-
-Linear (Classic) Directories
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-By default, each directory lists its entries in an “almost-linear”
-array. I write “almost” because it's not a linear array in the memory
-sense because directory entries are not split across filesystem blocks.
-Therefore, it is more accurate to say that a directory is a series of
-data blocks and that each block contains a linear array of directory
-entries. The end of each per-block array is signified by reaching the
-end of the block; the last entry in the block has a record length that
-takes it all the way to the end of the block. The end of the entire
-directory is of course signified by reaching the end of the file. Unused
-directory entries are signified by inode = 0. By default the filesystem
-uses ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` for directory entries unless the
-“filetype” feature flag is not set, in which case it uses
-``struct ext4_dir_entry``.
-
-The original directory entry format is ``struct ext4_dir_entry``, which
-is at most 263 bytes long, though on disk you'll need to reference
-``dirent.rec_len`` to know for sure.
-
-.. list-table::
-   :widths: 8 8 24 40
-   :header-rows: 1
-
-   * - Offset
-     - Size
-     - Name
-     - Description
-   * - 0x0
-     - __le32
-     - inode
-     - Number of the inode that this directory entry points to.
-   * - 0x4
-     - __le16
-     - rec_len
-     - Length of this directory entry. Must be a multiple of 4.
-   * - 0x6
-     - __le16

-     - Length of the file name.
-   * - 0x8
-     - char
-     - name[EXT4_NAME_LEN]
-     - File name.
-
-Since file names cannot be longer than 255 bytes, the new directory
-entry format shortens the name_len field and uses the space for a file
-type flag, probably to avoid having to load every inode during directory
-tree traversal. This format is ``ext4_dir_entry_2``, which is at most
-263 bytes long, though on disk you'll need to reference
-``dirent.rec_len`` to know for sure.

-Hash Tree Directories
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-A linear array of directory entries isn't great for performance, so a
-new feature was added to ext3 to provide a faster (but peculiar)
-balanced tree keyed off a hash of the directory entry name. If the
-EXT4_INDEX_FL (0x1000) flag is set in the inode, this directory uses a
-hashed btree (htree) to organize and find directory entries. For
-backwards read-only compatibility with ext2, this tree is actually
-hidden inside the directory file, masquerading as “empty” directory data
-blocks! It was stated previously that the end of the linear directory
-entry table was signified with an entry pointing to inode 0; this is
-(ab)used to fool the old linear-scan algorithm into thinking that the
-rest of the directory block is empty so that it moves on.
-
-The root of the tree always lives in the first data block of the
-directory. By ext2 custom, the '.' and '..' entries must appear at the
-beginning of this first block, so they are put here as two
-``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` s and not stored in the tree. The rest of
-the root node contains metadata about the tree and finally a hash->block
-map to find nodes that are lower in the htree. If
-``dx_root.info.indirect_levels`` is non-zero then the htree has two
-levels; the data block pointed to by the root node's map is an interior
-node, which is indexed by a minor hash. Interior nodes in this tree
-contains a zeroed out ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` followed by a
-minor_hash->block map to find leafe nodes. Leaf nodes contain a linear
-array of all ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2``; all of these entries
-(presumably) hash to the same value. If there is an overflow, the
-entries simply overflow into the next leaf node, and the
-least-significant bit of the hash (in the interior node map) that gets
-us to this next leaf node is set.
-
-To traverse the directory as a htree, the code calculates the hash of
-the desired file name and uses it to find the corresponding block
-number. If the tree is flat, the block is a linear array of directory
-entries that can be searched; otherwise, the minor hash of the file name
-is computed and used against this second block to find the corresponding
-third block number. That third block number will be a linear array of
-directory entries.
-
-To traverse the directory as a linear array (such as the old code does),
-the code simply reads every data block in the directory. The blocks used
-for the htree will appear to have no entries (aside from '.' and '..')
-and so only the leaf nodes will appear to have any interesting content.
-
-The root of the htree is in ``struct dx_root``, which is the full length
-of a data block:

+Index Nodes
+-----------
+
+In a regular UNIX filesystem, the inode stores all the metadata
+pertaining to the file (time stamps, block maps, extended attributes,
+etc), not the directory entry. To find the information associated with a
+file, one must traverse the directory files to find the directory entry
+associated with a file, then load the inode to find the metadata for
+that file. ext4 appears to cheat (for performance reasons) a little bit
+by storing a copy of the file type (normally stored in the inode) in the
+directory entry. (Compare all this to FAT, which stores all the file
+information directly in the directory entry, but does not support hard
+links and is in general more seek-happy than ext4 due to its simpler
+block allocator and extensive use of linked lists.)
+
+The inode table is a linear array of ``struct ext4_inode``. The table is
+sized to have enough blocks to store at least
+``sb.s_inode_size * sb.s_inodes_per_group`` bytes. The number of the
+block group containing an inode can be calculated as
+``(inode_number - 1) / sb.s_inodes_per_group``, and the offset into the
+group's table is ``(inode_number - 1) % sb.s_inodes_per_group``. There
+is no inode 0.
+
+The inode checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the inode number,
+and the inode structure itself.
+
+The inode table entry is laid out in ``struct ext4_inode``.

+
+Inode Size
+~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In ext2 and ext3, the inode structure size was fixed at 128 bytes
+(``EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE``) and each inode had a disk record size of
+128 bytes. Starting with ext4, it is possible to allocate a larger
+on-disk inode at format time for all inodes in the filesystem to provide
+space beyond the end of the original ext2 inode. The on-disk inode
+record size is recorded in the superblock as ``s_inode_size``. The
+number of bytes actually used by struct ext4_inode beyond the original
+128-byte ext2 inode is recorded in the ``i_extra_isize`` field for each
+inode, which allows struct ext4_inode to grow for a new kernel without
+having to upgrade all of the on-disk inodes. Access to fields beyond
+EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE should be verified to be within
+``i_extra_isize``. By default, ext4 inode records are 256 bytes, and (as
+of August 2019) the inode structure is 160 bytes
+(``i_extra_isize = 32``). The extra space between the end of the inode
+structure and the end of the inode record can be used to store extended
+attributes. Each inode record can be as large as the filesystem block
+size, though this is not terribly efficient.
+
+Finding an Inode
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Each block group contains ``sb->s_inodes_per_group`` inodes. Because
+inode 0 is defined not to exist, this formula can be used to find the
+block group that an inode lives in:
+``bg = (inode_num - 1) / sb->s_inodes_per_group``. The particular inode
+can be found within the block group's inode table at
+``index = (inode_num - 1) % sb->s_inodes_per_group``. To get the byte
+address within the inode table, use
+``offset = index * sb->s_inode_size``.
+
+Inode Timestamps
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Four timestamps are recorded in the lower 128 bytes of the inode
+structure -- inode change time (ctime), access time (atime), data
+modification time (mtime), and deletion time (dtime). The four fields
+are 32-bit signed integers that represent seconds since the Unix epoch
+(1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT), which means that the fields will overflow in
+January 2038. If the filesystem does not have orphan_file feature, inodes
+that are not linked from any directory but are still open (orphan inodes) have
+the dtime field overloaded for use with the orphan list. The superblock field
+``s_last_orphan`` points to the first inode in the orphan list; dtime is then
+the number of the next orphaned inode, or zero if there are no more orphans.
+
+If the inode structure size ``sb->s_inode_size`` is larger than 128
+bytes and the ``i_inode_extra`` field is large enough to encompass the
+respective ``i_[cma]time_extra`` field, the ctime, atime, and mtime
+inode fields are widened to 64 bits. Within this “extra” 32-bit field,
+the lower two bits are used to extend the 32-bit seconds field to be 34
+bit wide; the upper 30 bits are used to provide nanosecond timestamp
+accuracy. Therefore, timestamps should not overflow until May 2446.
+dtime was not widened. There is also a fifth timestamp to record inode
+creation time (crtime); this field is 64-bits wide and decoded in the
+same manner as 64-bit [cma]time. Neither crtime nor dtime are accessible
+through the regular stat() interface, though debugfs will report them.
+
+We use the 32-bit signed time value plus (2^32 * (extra epoch bits)).

+     - 2378-04-22 to 2446-05-10
+
+This is a somewhat odd encoding since there are effectively seven times
+as many positive values as negative values. There have also been
+long-standing bugs decoding and encoding dates beyond 2038, which don't
+seem to be fixed as of kernel 3.12 and e2fsprogs 1.42.8. 64-bit kernels
+incorrectly use the extra epoch bits 1,1 for dates between 1901 and
+1970. At some point the kernel will be fixed and e2fsck will fix this
+situation, assuming that it is run before 2310.
+
+The Contents of inode.i_block
+------------------------------
+
+Depending on the type of file an inode describes, the 60 bytes of
+storage in ``inode.i_block`` can be used in different ways. In general,
+regular files and directories will use it for file block indexing
+information, and special files will use it for special purposes.
+
+Symbolic Links
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+The target of a symbolic link will be stored in this field if the target
+string is less than 60 bytes long. Otherwise, either extents or block
+maps will be used to allocate data blocks to store the link target.
+
+Direct/Indirect Block Addressing
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In ext2/3, file block numbers were mapped to logical block numbers by
+means of an (up to) three level 1-1 block map. To find the logical block
+that stores a particular file block, the code would navigate through
+this increasingly complicated structure. Notice that there is neither a
+magic number nor a checksum to provide any level of confidence that the
+block isn't full of garbage.
+
+.. ifconfig:: builder != 'latex'
+
+   .. include:: blockmap.rst
+
+.. ifconfig:: builder == 'latex'
+
+   [Table omitted because LaTeX doesn't support nested tables.]
+
+Note that with this block mapping scheme, it is necessary to fill out a
+lot of mapping data even for a large contiguous file! This inefficiency
+led to the creation of the extent mapping scheme, discussed below.
+
+Notice also that a file using this mapping scheme cannot be placed
+higher than 2^32 blocks.
+
+Extent Tree
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+In ext4, the file to logical block map has been replaced with an extent
+tree. Under the old scheme, allocating a contiguous run of 1,000 blocks
+requires an indirect block to map all 1,000 entries; with extents, the
+mapping is reduced to a single ``struct ext4_extent`` with
+``ee_len = 1000``. If flex_bg is enabled, it is possible to allocate
+very large files with a single extent, at a considerable reduction in
+metadata block use, and some improvement in disk efficiency. The inode
+must have the extents flag (0x80000) flag set for this feature to be in
+use.
+
+Extents are arranged as a tree. Each node of the tree begins with a
+``struct ext4_extent_header``. If the node is an interior node
+(``eh.eh_depth`` > 0), the header is followed by ``eh.eh_entries``
+instances of ``struct ext4_extent_idx``; each of these index entries
+points to a block containing more nodes in the extent tree. If the node
+is a leaf node (``eh.eh_depth == 0``), then the header is followed by
+``eh.eh_entries`` instances of ``struct ext4_extent``; these instances
+point to the file's data blocks. The root node of the extent tree is
+stored in ``inode.i_block``, which allows for the first four extents to
+be recorded without the use of extra metadata blocks.
+
+The extent tree header is recorded in ``struct ext4_extent_header``,
+which is 12 bytes long:

+       block number can be at most ``2^32``, and the smallest ``n`` that

+       32768. Therefore, the maximum length of a initialized extent is 32768

+
+Prior to the introduction of metadata checksums, the extent header +
+extent entries always left at least 4 bytes of unallocated space at the
+end of each extent tree data block (because (2^x % 12) >= 4). Therefore,
+the 32-bit checksum is inserted into this space. The 4 extents in the
+inode do not need checksumming, since the inode is already checksummed.
+The checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the inode number, the
+inode generation, and the entire extent block leading up to (but not
+including) the checksum itself.
+

+
+Inline Data
+~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+If the inline data feature is enabled for the filesystem and the flag is
+set for the inode, it is possible that the first 60 bytes of the file
+data are stored here.
+
+Directory Entries
+-----------------
+
+In an ext4 filesystem, a directory is more or less a flat file that maps
+an arbitrary byte string (usually ASCII) to an inode number on the
+filesystem. There can be many directory entries across the filesystem
+that reference the same inode number--these are known as hard links, and
+that is why hard links cannot reference files on other filesystems. As
+such, directory entries are found by reading the data block(s)
+associated with a directory file for the particular directory entry that
+is desired.
+
+Linear (Classic) Directories
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+By default, each directory lists its entries in an “almost-linear”
+array. I write “almost” because it's not a linear array in the memory
+sense because directory entries are not split across filesystem blocks.
+Therefore, it is more accurate to say that a directory is a series of
+data blocks and that each block contains a linear array of directory
+entries. The end of each per-block array is signified by reaching the
+end of the block; the last entry in the block has a record length that
+takes it all the way to the end of the block. The end of the entire
+directory is of course signified by reaching the end of the file. Unused
+directory entries are signified by inode = 0. By default the filesystem
+uses ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` for directory entries unless the
+“filetype” feature flag is not set, in which case it uses
+``struct ext4_dir_entry``.
+
+The original directory entry format is ``struct ext4_dir_entry``, which
+is at most 263 bytes long, though on disk you'll need to reference
+``dirent.rec_len`` to know for sure.

+263 bytes long, though on disk you'll need to reference

+In order to add checksums to these classic directory blocks, a phony

+directory entry.
+
+Hash Tree Directories
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+A linear array of directory entries isn't great for performance, so a
+new feature was added to ext3 to provide a faster (but peculiar)
+balanced tree keyed off a hash of the directory entry name. If the
+EXT4_INDEX_FL (0x1000) flag is set in the inode, this directory uses a
+hashed btree (htree) to organize and find directory entries. For
+backwards read-only compatibility with ext2, this tree is actually
+hidden inside the directory file, masquerading as “empty” directory data
+blocks! It was stated previously that the end of the linear directory
+entry table was signified with an entry pointing to inode 0; this is
+(ab)used to fool the old linear-scan algorithm into thinking that the
+rest of the directory block is empty so that it moves on.
+
+The root of the tree always lives in the first data block of the
+directory. By ext2 custom, the '.' and '..' entries must appear at the
+beginning of this first block, so they are put here as two
+``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` s and not stored in the tree. The rest of
+the root node contains metadata about the tree and finally a hash->block
+map to find nodes that are lower in the htree. If
+``dx_root.info.indirect_levels`` is non-zero then the htree has two
+levels; the data block pointed to by the root node's map is an interior
+node, which is indexed by a minor hash. Interior nodes in this tree
+contains a zeroed out ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` followed by a
+minor_hash->block map to find leafe nodes. Leaf nodes contain a linear
+array of all ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2``; all of these entries
+(presumably) hash to the same value. If there is an overflow, the
+entries simply overflow into the next leaf node, and the
+least-significant bit of the hash (in the interior node map) that gets
+us to this next leaf node is set.
+
+To traverse the directory as a htree, the code calculates the hash of
+the desired file name and uses it to find the corresponding block
+number. If the tree is flat, the block is a linear array of directory
+entries that can be searched; otherwise, the minor hash of the file name
+is computed and used against this second block to find the corresponding
+third block number. That third block number will be a linear array of
+directory entries.
+
+To traverse the directory as a linear array (such as the old code does),
+the code simply reads every data block in the directory. The blocks used
+for the htree will appear to have no entries (aside from '.' and '..')
+and so only the leaf nodes will appear to have any interesting content.
+
+The root of the htree is in ``struct dx_root``, which is the full length
+of a data block:

+     - As many 8-byte ``struct dx_entry`` as fits in the rest of the data block.

+long:

+
+(If you think this is all quite clever and peculiar, so does the
+author.)
+
+If metadata checksums are enabled, the last 8 bytes of the directory
+block (precisely the length of one dx_entry) are used to store a
+``struct dx_tail``, which contains the checksum. The ``limit`` and
+``count`` entries in the dx_root/dx_node structures are adjusted as
+necessary to fit the dx_tail into the block. If there is no space for
+the dx_tail, the user is notified to run e2fsck -D to rebuild the
+directory index (which will ensure that there's space for the checksum.
+The dx_tail structure is 8 bytes long and looks like this:
+
+.. list-table::
+   :widths: 8 8 24 40

+   * - 0x4
+     - __le32
+     - dt_checksum
+     - Checksum of the htree directory block.
+
+The checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the htree index header
+(dx_root or dx_node), all of the htree indices (dx_entry) that are in
+use, and the tail block (dx_tail).
+
+Extended Attributes
+-------------------
+
+Extended attributes (xattrs) are typically stored in a separate data
+block on the disk and referenced from inodes via ``inode.i_file_acl*``.
+The first use of extended attributes seems to have been for storing file
+ACLs and other security data (selinux). With the ``user_xattr`` mount
+option it is possible for users to store extended attributes so long as
+all attribute names begin with “user”; this restriction seems to have
+disappeared as of Linux 3.0.
+
+There are two places where extended attributes can be found. The first
+place is between the end of each inode entry and the beginning of the
+next inode entry. For example, if inode.i_extra_isize = 28 and
+sb.inode_size = 256, then there are 256 - (128 + 28) = 100 bytes
+available for in-inode extended attribute storage. The second place
+where extended attributes can be found is in the block pointed to by
+``inode.i_file_acl``. As of Linux 3.11, it is not possible for this
+block to contain a pointer to a second extended attribute block (or even
+the remaining blocks of a cluster). In theory it is possible for each
+attribute's value to be stored in a separate data block, though as of
+Linux 3.11 the code does not permit this.
+
+Keys are generally assumed to be ASCIIZ strings, whereas values can be
+strings or binary data.
+
+Extended attributes, when stored after the inode, have a header
+``ext4_xattr_ibody_header`` that is 4 bytes long:
+
+.. list-table::
+   :widths: 8 8 24 40
+   :header-rows: 1
+
+   * - Offset
+     - Type
+     - Name
+     - Description
+   * - 0x0
+     - __le32
+     - h_magic
+     - Magic number for identification, 0xEA020000. This value is set by the
+       Linux driver, though e2fsprogs doesn't seem to check it(?)
+
+The beginning of an extended attribute block is in
+``struct ext4_xattr_header``, which is 32 bytes long:
+
+.. list-table::
+   :widths: 8 8 24 40
+   :header-rows: 1

+   * - 0x4
+     - __le32
+     - h_refcount
+     - Reference count.
+   * - 0x8
+     - __le32
+     - h_blocks
+     - Number of disk blocks used.
+   * - 0xC
+     - __le32
+     - h_hash
+     - Hash value of all attributes.
+   * - 0x10
+     - __le32
+     - h_checksum
+     - Checksum of the extended attribute block.
+   * - 0x14
+     - __u32
+     - h_reserved[3]
+     - Zero.
+
+The checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the 64-bit block number
+of the extended attribute block, and the entire block (header +
+entries).
+
+Following the ``struct ext4_xattr_header`` or
+``struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header`` is an array of
+``struct ext4_xattr_entry``; each of these entries is at least 16 bytes
+long. When stored in an external block, the ``struct ext4_xattr_entry``
+entries must be stored in sorted order. The sort order is
+``e_name_index``, then ``e_name_len``, and finally ``e_name``.
+Attributes stored inside an inode do not need be stored in sorted order.

+       this value is relative to the start of the first entry; for a block this
+       value is relative to the start of the block (i.e. the header).
+   * - 0x4
+     - __le32
+     - e_value_inum
+     - The inode where the value is stored. Zero indicates the value is in the

+   * - 0x8

+     - e_value_size
+     - Length of attribute value.
+   * - 0xC
+     - __le32
+     - e_hash
+     - Hash value of attribute name and attribute value. The kernel doesn't
+       update the hash for in-inode attributes, so for that case this value
+       must be zero, because e2fsck validates any non-zero hash regardless of
+       where the xattr lives.
+   * - 0x10
+     - char
+     - e_name[e_name_len]
+     - Attribute name. Does not include trailing NULL.
+
+Attribute values can follow the end of the entry table. There appears to
+be a requirement that they be aligned to 4-byte boundaries. The values
+are stored starting at the end of the block and grow towards the
+xattr_header/xattr_entry table. When the two collide, the overflow is
+put into a separate disk block. If the disk block fills up, the
+filesystem returns -ENOSPC.
+
+The first four fields of the ``ext4_xattr_entry`` are set to zero to
+mark the end of the key list.
+
+Attribute Name Indices
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Logically speaking, extended attributes are a series of key=value pairs.
+The keys are assumed to be NULL-terminated strings. To reduce the amount
+of on-disk space that the keys consume, the beginning of the key string
+is matched against the attribute name index. If a match is found, the
+attribute name index field is set, and matching string is removed from
+the key name. Here is a map of name index values to key prefixes:
+
+.. list-table::
+   :widths: 16 64
+   :header-rows: 1
+
+   * - Name Index
+     - Key Prefix
+   * - 0
+     - (no prefix)
+   * - 1
+     - “user.”
+   * - 2
+     - “system.posix_acl_access”
+   * - 3
+     - “system.posix_acl_default”
+   * - 4
+     - “trusted.”
+   * - 6
+     - “security.”
+   * - 7
+     - “system.” (inline_data only?)
+   * - 8
+     - “system.richacl” (SuSE kernels only?)
+
+For example, if the attribute key is “user.fubar”, the attribute name
+index is set to 1 and the “fubar” name is recorded on disk.
+
+POSIX ACLs
+~~~~~~~~~~
+
+POSIX ACLs are stored in a reduced version of the Linux kernel (and
+libacl's) internal ACL format. The key difference is that the version
+number is different (1) and the ``e_id`` field is only stored for named
+user and group ACLs.

-Direct/Indirect Block Addressing
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-In ext2/3, file block numbers were mapped to logical block numbers by
-means of an (up to) three level 1-1 block map. To find the logical block
-that stores a particular file block, the code would navigate through
-this increasingly complicated structure. Notice that there is neither a
-magic number nor a checksum to provide any level of confidence that the
-block isn't full of garbage.

-
-   .. include:: blockmap.rst
-
-.. ifconfig:: builder == 'latex'
-
-   [Table omitted because LaTeX doesn't support nested tables.]
-
-Note that with this block mapping scheme, it is necessary to fill out a
-lot of mapping data even for a large contiguous file! This inefficiency
-led to the creation of the extent mapping scheme, discussed below.
-
-Notice also that a file using this mapping scheme cannot be placed
-higher than 2^32 blocks.
-
-Extent Tree
-~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-In ext4, the file to logical block map has been replaced with an extent
-tree. Under the old scheme, allocating a contiguous run of 1,000 blocks
-requires an indirect block to map all 1,000 entries; with extents, the
-mapping is reduced to a single ``struct ext4_extent`` with
-``ee_len = 1000``. If flex_bg is enabled, it is possible to allocate
-very large files with a single extent, at a considerable reduction in
-metadata block use, and some improvement in disk efficiency. The inode
-must have the extents flag (0x80000) flag set for this feature to be in
-use.
-
-Extents are arranged as a tree. Each node of the tree begins with a
-``struct ext4_extent_header``. If the node is an interior node
-(``eh.eh_depth`` > 0), the header is followed by ``eh.eh_entries``
-instances of ``struct ext4_extent_idx``; each of these index entries
-points to a block containing more nodes in the extent tree. If the node
-is a leaf node (``eh.eh_depth == 0``), then the header is followed by
-``eh.eh_entries`` instances of ``struct ext4_extent``; these instances
-point to the file's data blocks. The root node of the extent tree is
-stored in ``inode.i_block``, which allows for the first four extents to
-be recorded without the use of extra metadata blocks.
-
-The extent tree header is recorded in ``struct ext4_extent_header``,
-which is 12 bytes long:

-     - Depth of this extent node in the extent tree. 0 = this extent node
-       points to data blocks; otherwise, this extent node points to other
-       extent nodes. The extent tree can be at most 5 levels deep: a logical
-       block number can be at most ``2^32``, and the smallest ``n`` that
-       satisfies ``4*(((blocksize - 12)/12)^n) >= 2^32`` is 5.
-   * - 0x8
-     - __le32
-     - eh_generation
-     - Generation of the tree. (Used by Lustre, but not standard ext4).
-
-Internal nodes of the extent tree, also known as index nodes, are
-recorded as ``struct ext4_extent_idx``, and are 12 bytes long:
-
-.. list-table::
-   :widths: 8 8 24 40

-   * - 0x4
-     - __le32
-     - ei_leaf_lo
-     - Lower 32-bits of the block number of the extent node that is the next
-       level lower in the tree. The tree node pointed to can be either another
-       internal node or a leaf node, described below.

-   :header-rows: 1
-

-     - Size
-     - Name
-     - Description
-   * - 0x0
-     - __le32
-     - ee_block
-     - First file block number that this extent covers.
-   * - 0x4
-     - __le16
-     - ee_len
-     - Number of blocks covered by extent. If the value of this field is <=
-       32768, the extent is initialized. If the value of the field is > 32768,
-       the extent is uninitialized and the actual extent length is ``ee_len`` -
-       32768. Therefore, the maximum length of a initialized extent is 32768
-       blocks, and the maximum length of an uninitialized extent is 32767.
-   * - 0x6
-     - __le16
-     - ee_start_hi
-     - Upper 16-bits of the block number to which this extent points.
-   * - 0x8
-     - __le32
-     - ee_start_lo
-     - Lower 32-bits of the block number to which this extent points.
-
-Prior to the introduction of metadata checksums, the extent header +
-extent entries always left at least 4 bytes of unallocated space at the
-end of each extent tree data block (because (2^x % 12) >= 4). Therefore,
-the 32-bit checksum is inserted into this space. The 4 extents in the
-inode do not need checksumming, since the inode is already checksummed.
-The checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the inode number, the
-inode generation, and the entire extent block leading up to (but not
-including) the checksum itself.
-
-``struct ext4_extent_tail`` is 4 bytes long:
-
-.. list-table::
-   :widths: 8 8 24 40
-   :header-rows: 1

-     - eb_checksum
-     - Checksum of the extent block, crc32c(uuid+inum+igeneration+extentblock)
-
-Inline Data

-If the inline data feature is enabled for the filesystem and the flag is
-set for the inode, it is possible that the first 60 bytes of the file
-data are stored here.

-Index Nodes
------------
-
-In a regular UNIX filesystem, the inode stores all the metadata
-pertaining to the file (time stamps, block maps, extended attributes,
-etc), not the directory entry. To find the information associated with a
-file, one must traverse the directory files to find the directory entry
-associated with a file, then load the inode to find the metadata for
-that file. ext4 appears to cheat (for performance reasons) a little bit
-by storing a copy of the file type (normally stored in the inode) in the
-directory entry. (Compare all this to FAT, which stores all the file
-information directly in the directory entry, but does not support hard
-links and is in general more seek-happy than ext4 due to its simpler
-block allocator and extensive use of linked lists.)
-
-The inode table is a linear array of ``struct ext4_inode``. The table is
-sized to have enough blocks to store at least
-``sb.s_inode_size * sb.s_inodes_per_group`` bytes. The number of the
-block group containing an inode can be calculated as
-``(inode_number - 1) / sb.s_inodes_per_group``, and the offset into the
-group's table is ``(inode_number - 1) % sb.s_inodes_per_group``. There
-is no inode 0.
-
-The inode checksum is calculated against the FS UUID, the inode number,
-and the inode structure itself.
-
-The inode table entry is laid out in ``struct ext4_inode``.

-       directory (each subdirectory's '..' entry counts as a hard link, as does
-       the '.' entry in the directory itself). With the DIR_NLINK feature

-       << 32)`` 512-byte blocks on disk. If huge_file is set and
-       EXT4_HUGE_FILE_FL IS set in ``inode.i_flags``, then this file

-Inode Size
-~~~~~~~~~~
-
-In ext2 and ext3, the inode structure size was fixed at 128 bytes
-(``EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE``) and each inode had a disk record size of
-128 bytes. Starting with ext4, it is possible to allocate a larger
-on-disk inode at format time for all inodes in the filesystem to provide
-space beyond the end of the original ext2 inode. The on-disk inode
-record size is recorded in the superblock as ``s_inode_size``. The
-number of bytes actually used by struct ext4_inode beyond the original
-128-byte ext2 inode is recorded in the ``i_extra_isize`` field for each
-inode, which allows struct ext4_inode to grow for a new kernel without
-having to upgrade all of the on-disk inodes. Access to fields beyond
-EXT2_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE should be verified to be within
-``i_extra_isize``. By default, ext4 inode records are 256 bytes, and (as
-of August 2019) the inode structure is 160 bytes
-(``i_extra_isize = 32``). The extra space between the end of the inode
-structure and the end of the inode record can be used to store extended
-attributes. Each inode record can be as large as the filesystem block
-size, though this is not terribly efficient.
-
-Finding an Inode
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Each block group contains ``sb->s_inodes_per_group`` inodes. Because
-inode 0 is defined not to exist, this formula can be used to find the
-block group that an inode lives in:
-``bg = (inode_num - 1) / sb->s_inodes_per_group``. The particular inode
-can be found within the block group's inode table at
-``index = (inode_num - 1) % sb->s_inodes_per_group``. To get the byte
-address within the inode table, use
-``offset = index * sb->s_inode_size``.
-
-Inode Timestamps
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Four timestamps are recorded in the lower 128 bytes of the inode
-structure -- inode change time (ctime), access time (atime), data
-modification time (mtime), and deletion time (dtime). The four fields
-are 32-bit signed integers that represent seconds since the Unix epoch
-(1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT), which means that the fields will overflow in
-January 2038. If the filesystem does not have orphan_file feature, inodes
-that are not linked from any directory but are still open (orphan inodes) have
-the dtime field overloaded for use with the orphan list. The superblock field
-``s_last_orphan`` points to the first inode in the orphan list; dtime is then
-the number of the next orphaned inode, or zero if there are no more orphans.
-
-If the inode structure size ``sb->s_inode_size`` is larger than 128
-bytes and the ``i_inode_extra`` field is large enough to encompass the
-respective ``i_[cma]time_extra`` field, the ctime, atime, and mtime
-inode fields are widened to 64 bits. Within this “extra” 32-bit field,
-the lower two bits are used to extend the 32-bit seconds field to be 34
-bit wide; the upper 30 bits are used to provide nanosecond timestamp
-accuracy. Therefore, timestamps should not overflow until May 2446.
-dtime was not widened. There is also a fifth timestamp to record inode
-creation time (crtime); this field is 64-bits wide and decoded in the
-same manner as 64-bit [cma]time. Neither crtime nor dtime are accessible
-through the regular stat() interface, though debugfs will report them.
-
-We use the 32-bit signed time value plus (2^32 * (extra epoch bits)).

-This is a somewhat odd encoding since there are effectively seven times
-as many positive values as negative values. There have also been
-long-standing bugs decoding and encoding dates beyond 2038, which don't
-seem to be fixed as of kernel 3.12 and e2fsprogs 1.42.8. 64-bit kernels
-incorrectly use the extra epoch bits 1,1 for dates between 1901 and
-1970. At some point the kernel will be fixed and e2fsck will fix this
-situation, assuming that it is run before 2310.
