Can we get some comments from crypto tree maintainers as well? I feel
like this patch series is more crypto patch than zswap patch, at this
point.

Can we land any zswap parts without the crypto API change? Grasping at
straws here, in case we can parallelize the reviewing and merging
process.

>  1) crypto acomp & iaa_crypto driver enablers for batching: Relevant
>     patches are tagged with "crypto:" in the subject:
>
>     Patch 1) Reorganizes the iaa_crypto driver code into logically relate=
d
>              sections and avoids forward declarations, in order to facili=
tate
>              subsequent iaa_crypto patches. This patch makes no
>              functional changes.
>
>     Patch 2) Makes an infrastructure change in the iaa_crypto driver
>              to map IAA devices/work-queues to cores based on packages
>              instead of NUMA nodes. This doesn't impact performance on
>              the Sapphire Rapids system used for performance
>              testing. However, this change fixes functional problems we
>              found on Granite Rapids during internal validation, where th=
e
>              number of NUMA nodes is greater than the number of packages,
>              which was resulting in over-utilization of some IAA devices
>              and non-usage of other IAA devices as per the current NUMA
>              based mapping infrastructure.
>
>              This patch also develops a new architecture that
>              generalizes how IAA device WQs are used. It enables
>              designating IAA device WQs as either compress-only or
>              decompress-only or generic. Once IAA device WQ types are
>              thus defined, it also allows the configuration of whether
>              device WQs will be shared by all cores on the package, or
>              used only by "mapped cores" obtained by a simple allocation
>              of available IAAs to cores on the package.
>
>              As a result of the overhaul of wq_table definition,
>              allocation and rebalancing, this patch eliminates
>              duplication of device WQs in per-CPU wq_tables, thereby
>              saving 140MiB on a 384 cores dual socket Granite Rapids serv=
er
>              with 8 IAAs.
>
>              Regardless of how the user has configured the WQs' usage,
>              the next WQ to use is obtained through a direct look-up in
>              per-CPU "cpu_comp_wqs" and "cpu_decomp_wqs" structures so
>              as to minimize latency in the critical path driver compress
>              and decompress routines.
>
>     Patch 3) Code cleanup, consistency of function parameters.
>
>     Patch 4) Makes a change to iaa_crypto driver's descriptor allocation,
>              from blocking to non-blocking with retries/timeouts and
>              mitigations in case of timeouts during compress/decompress
>              ops. This prevents tasks getting blocked indefinitely, which
>              was observed when testing 30 cores running workloads, with
>              only 1 IAA enabled on Sapphire Rapids (out of 4). These
>              timeouts are typically only encountered, and associated
>              mitigations exercised, only in configurations with 1 IAA
>              device shared by 30+ cores.
>
>     Patch 5) Optimize iaa_wq refcounts using a percpu_ref instead of
>              spinlocks and "int refcount".
>
>     Patch 6) Code simplification and restructuring for understandability
>              in core iaa_compress() and iaa_decompress() routines.
>
>     Patch 7) Refactor hardware descriptor setup to their own procedures
>              to reduce code clutter.

>     Patch 8) Simplify and optimize (i.e. reduce computes) job submission
>              for the most commonly used non-irq async mode by directly
>              calling movdir64b.
>
>     Patch 9) Deprecate exporting symbols for adding IAA compression
>              modes.

> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> 1) Rebased to mm-unstable as of 7-30-2025, commit 01da54f10fdd.
> 2) Added change logging in patch 0024 on there being no Intel-specific
>    dependencies in the batching framework, as suggested by
>    Andrew Morton. Thanks Andrew!
> 3) Added change logging in patch 0024 on other ongoing work that can use
>    batching, as per Andrew's suggestion. Thanks Andrew!
> 4) Added the IAA configuration script in the cover letter, as suggested
>    by Nhat Pham. Thanks Nhat!
> 5) As suggested by Nhat, dropped patch 0020 from v10, that moves CPU
>    hotplug procedures to pool functions.
> 6) Gathered kernel_compilation 'allmod' config performance data with
>    writeback and zswap shrinker_enabled=3DY.
> 7) Changed the pool->batch_size for software compressors to be
>    ZSWAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE since this gives better performance with the zswa=
p
>    shrinker enabled.
> 8) Was unable to replicate in v11 the issue seen in v10 with higher
>    memcg_swap_fail than in the baseline, with usemem30/zstd.
>
> Changes since v9:
> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> 1) Rebased to mm-unstable as of 6-24-2025, commit 23b9c0472ea3.
> 2) iaa_crypto rearchitecting, mainline race condition fix, performance
>    optimizations, code cleanup.
> 3) Addressed Herbert's comments in v9 patch 10, that an array based
>    crypto_acomp interface is not acceptable.
> 4) Optimized the implementation of the batching zswap_compress() and
>    zswap_store_pages() added in v9, to recover performance when
>    integrated with the changes in commit 56e5a103a721 ("zsmalloc: prefer
>    the the original page's node for compressed data").
>
> Changes since v8:
> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> 1) Rebased to mm-unstable as of 4-21-2025, commit 2c01d9f3c611.
> 2) Backported commits for reverting request chaining, since these are
>    in cryptodev-2.6 but not yet in mm-unstable: without these backports,
>    deflate-iaa is non-functional in mm-unstable:
>    commit 64929fe8c0a4 ("crypto: acomp - Remove request chaining")
>    commit 5976fe19e240 ("Revert "crypto: testmgr - Add multibuffer acomp
>                          testing"")
>    Backported this hotfix as well:
>    commit 002ba346e3d7 ("crypto: scomp - Fix off-by-one bug when
>    calculating last page").
> 3) crypto_acomp_[de]compress() restored to non-request chained
>    implementations since request chaining has been removed from acomp in
>    commit 64929fe8c0a4 ("crypto: acomp - Remove request chaining").
> 4) New IAA WQ architecture to denote WQ type and whether or not a WQ
>    should be shared among all package cores, or only to the "mapped"
>    ones from an even cores-to-IAA distribution scheme.
> 5) Compress/decompress batching are implemented in iaa_crypto using new
>    crypto_acomp_batch_compress()/crypto_acomp_batch_decompress() API.
> 6) Defines a "void *data" in struct acomp_req, based on Herbert advising
>    against using req->base.data in the driver. This is needed for async
>    submit-poll to work.
> 7) In zswap.c, moved the CPU hotplug callbacks to reside in "pool
>    functions", per Yosry's suggestion to move procedures in a distinct
>    patch before refactoring patches.
> 8) A new "u8 nr_reqs" member is added to "struct zswap_pool" to track
>    the number of requests/buffers associated with the per-cpu acomp_ctx,
>    as per Yosry's suggestion.
> 9) Simplifications to the acomp_ctx resources allocation, deletion,
>    locking, and for these to exist from pool creation to pool deletion,
>    based on v8 code review discussions with Yosry.
> 10) Use IS_ERR_OR_NULL() consistently in zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() and
>     acomp_ctx_dealloc(), as per Yosry's v8 comment.
> 11) zswap_store_folio() is deleted, and instead, the loop over
>     zswap_store_pages() is moved inline in zswap_store(), per Yosry's
>     suggestion.
> 12) Better structure in zswap_compress(), unified procedure that
>     compresses/stores a batch of pages for both, non-batching and
>     batching compressors. Renamed from zswap_batch_compress() to
>     zswap_compress(): Thanks Yosry for these suggestions.

> Changes since v7:
> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> 1) Rebased to mm-unstable as of 3-3-2025, commit 5f089a9aa987.
> 2) Changed the acomp_ctx->nr_reqs to be u8 since ZSWAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE is
>    defined as 8U, for saving memory in this per-cpu structure.
> 3) Fixed a typo in code comments in acomp_ctx_get_cpu_lock():
>    acomp_ctx->initialized to acomp_ctx->__online.
> 4) Incorporated suggestions from Yosry, Chengming, Nhat and Johannes,
>    thanks to all!
>    a) zswap_batch_compress() replaces zswap_compress(). Thanks Yosry
>       for this suggestion!
>    b) Process the folio in sub-batches of ZSWAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE, regardles=
s
>       of whether or not the compressor supports batching. This gets rid o=
f
>       the kmalloc(entries), and allows us to allocate an array of
>       ZSWAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE entries on the stack. This is implemented in
>       zswap_store_pages().
>    c) Use of a common structure and code paths for compressing a folio in
>       batches, either as a request chain (in parallel in IAA hardware) or
>       sequentially. No code duplication since zswap_compress() has been
>       replaced with zswap_batch_compress(), simplifying maintainability.
> 5) A key difference between compressors that support batching and
>    those that do not, is that for the latter, the acomp_ctx mutex is
>    locked/unlocked per ZSWAP_MAX_BATCH_SIZE batch, so that decompressions
>    to handle page-faults can make progress. This fixes the zstd kernel
>    compilation regression seen in v7. For compressors that support
>    batching, for e.g. IAA, the mutex is locked/released once for storing
>    the folio.
> 6) Used likely/unlikely compiler directives and prefetchw to restore
>    performance with the common code paths.

> Changes since v6:
> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
> 1) Rebased to mm-unstable as of 2-27-2025, commit d58172d128ac.
>
> 2) Deleted crypto_acomp_batch_compress() and
>    crypto_acomp_batch_decompress() interfaces, as per Herbert's
>    suggestion. Batching is instead enabled by chaining the requests. For
>    non-batching compressors, there is no request chaining involved. Both,
>    batching and non-batching compressions are accomplished by zswap by
>    calling:
>
>    crypto_wait_req(crypto_acomp_compress(acomp_ctx->reqs[0]), &acomp_ctx-=
>wait);
>
> 3) iaa_crypto implementation of batch compressions/decompressions using
>    request chaining, as per Herbert's suggestions.
> 4) Simplification of the acomp_ctx resource allocation/deletion with
>    respect to CPU hot[un]plug, to address Yosry's suggestions to explore =
the
>    mutex options in zswap_cpu_comp_prepare(). Yosry, please let me know i=
f
>    the per-cpu memory cost of this proposed change is acceptable (IAA:
>    64.8KB, Software compressors: 8.2KB). On the positive side, I believe
>    restarting reclaim on a CPU after it has been through an offline-onlin=
e
>    transition, will be much faster by not deleting the acomp_ctx resource=
s
>    when the CPU gets offlined.
> 5) Use of lockdep assertions rather than comments for internal locking
>    rules, as per Yosry's suggestion.
> 6) No specific references to IAA in zswap.c, as suggested by Yosry.
> 7) Explored various solutions other than the v6 zswap_store_folio()
>    implementation, to fix the zstd regression seen in v5, to attempt to
>    unify common code paths, and to allocate smaller arrays for the zswap
>    entries on the stack. All these options were found to cause usemem30
>    latency regression with zstd. The v6 version of zswap_store_folio() is
>    the only implementation that does not cause zstd regression, confirmed
>    by 10 consecutive runs, each giving quite consistent latency
>    numbers. Hence, the v6 implementation is carried forward to v7, with
>    changes for branching for batching vs. sequential compression API
>    calls.

> Kanchana P Sridhar (24):
>   crypto: iaa - Reorganize the iaa_crypto driver code.
>   crypto: iaa - New architecture for IAA device WQ comp/decomp usage &
>     core mapping.
>   crypto: iaa - Simplify, consistency of function parameters, minor
>     stats bug fix.
>   crypto: iaa - Descriptor allocation timeouts with mitigations.
>   crypto: iaa - iaa_wq uses percpu_refs for get/put reference counting.
>   crypto: iaa - Simplify the code flow in iaa_compress() and
>     iaa_decompress().
>   crypto: iaa - Refactor hardware descriptor setup into separate
>     procedures.
>   crypto: iaa - Simplified, efficient job submissions for non-irq mode.
>   crypto: iaa - Deprecate exporting add/remove IAA compression modes.
>   crypto: iaa - Rearchitect the iaa_crypto driver to be usable by zswap
>     and zram.
>   crypto: iaa - Enablers for submitting descriptors then polling for
>     completion.
>   crypto: acomp - Add "void *kernel_data" in "struct acomp_req" for
>     kernel users.
>   crypto: iaa - IAA Batching for parallel compressions/decompressions.
>   crypto: iaa - Enable async mode and make it the default.
>   crypto: iaa - Disable iaa_verify_compress by default.
>   crypto: iaa - Submit the two largest source buffers first in
>     decompress batching.
>   crypto: iaa - Add deflate-iaa-dynamic compression mode.
>   crypto: acomp - Add crypto_acomp_batch_size() to get an algorithm's
>     batch-size.
>   crypto: iaa - IAA acomp_algs register the get_batch_size() interface.
>   mm: zswap: Per-CPU acomp_ctx resources exist from pool creation to
>     deletion.
>   mm: zswap: Consistently use IS_ERR_OR_NULL() to check acomp_ctx
>     resources.
>   mm: zswap: Allocate pool batching resources if the compressor supports
>     batching.
>   mm: zswap: zswap_store() will process a large folio in batches.
>   mm: zswap: Batched zswap_compress() with compress batching of large
>     folios.
