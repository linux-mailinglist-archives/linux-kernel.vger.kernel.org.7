There is so many cc across the series that I am reluctant to copy 
everyone on all patches. So I count on people being subscribed to 
mailing lists and being able to look into the archives if all else fails.

Regarding the luke warm response here is short video showing it in action:

https://people.igalia.com/tursulin/drm_cgroup.mp4

Please ignore the typos made in the video commentary but I would say it 
is worth a watch.

Lets see if that helps to paint a picture to people on what this can do. 
With some minimum imagination different use cases are obvious as well. 
For example start a compute job in the background with the UI still 
being responsive.

For all drivers which use the DRM scheduler in the 1:N mode it is 
trivial to wire the support up once the "fair" DRM scheduler lands. 
Trivial because scheduling weight is directly compatible with virtual 
GPU time accounting fair scheduler implements. This series has an 
example how to do it for amdgpu and many other simple drivers could do 
it exactly like with a few lines of boilerplate code.

For some 1:1 firmware scheduling drivers, like xe for example, patch 
series also includes a sketch on how it could make use drm.weight by 
giving firmware a hint what is the most important, and what is least 
important. In practice that is also usable for some use cases. (In fact 
the demo video above was made with xe! Results with amdgpu are pretty 
similar but I hit some snags with screen recording on that device.)

Possibly the main problem causing the luke warm response, as far as I 
understood during the XDC last month, is what to do about the drivers 
where seemingly neither approach can be implemented.

Like nouveau for example. Thinking seems to be it couldn't be wired up. 
I don't know that driver nor hardware (firmware) so I cannot say.

To satisfy that concern one idea I had is that perhaps I could expose a 
new control file like drm.weight_supported or something, which could 
have a semantics along the lines of:

  + - all active client/drivers in the cgroup support the feature
  ? - a mix of supported and unsupported
  - - none support the drm.weight feature

That would give visibility to the "Why is this thing not doing anything 
on my system?" question. Then over time solutions on how to support even 
those problematic drivers with closed firmware could be found. There 
will certainly be motivation not to be the one with worse user experience.

Tvrtko
