What do you mean by "6.12 kernel + backported scheduler patches" ? Do
you mean android mainline v6.12 ?

I run my test with android mainline v6.13 + scheduler patches for
v6.14 and v6.15-rc1. Do you mean the same ? v6.12 misses a number of
important patches in regards to threads accounting

same for me

What do you mean exactly by (one iteration each for 5 iterations with
cooldowns) ?

I'd like to reproduce this use case because my test with 4k video
playback shows similar or slightly better power consumption (2%) with
this patch.

Do you have details about this use case that you can share ?

I'm interested to understand why the average frequency increases as
the OPP remains the 1st level of selection and in case of light loaded
use cases we should not see much difference. That's what I see on my
4k video playback use case

And I will also look at why the CAS is better in your case

I supposed that I won't be able to reproduce this one

I see a difference here mainly for DDR power consumption with 7%
saving compared to mainline and 2% on the CPU clusters

On the push mechanism side, I'm surprised that you don't get more push
than once every 2-20 minutes. On the speedometer, I've got around 170
push fair and 600 check pushable which ends with a task migration
during the 75 seconds of the test and much more calls that ends with
the same cpu. This also needs to be compared with the 70% of
overutilized state during the 75 seconds of the time during which we
don't push. On light loaded case, the condition is currently to
conservative to trigger push task mechanism but that's also expected
in order to be conservative

The fact that OU triggers too quickly limits the impact of push and feec rework

uclamp_max sees a difference with the push mechanism which is another
argument for using it.

And this is 1st step is quite conservative before extending the cases
which can benefit from push and feec rework as explained  at OSPM
