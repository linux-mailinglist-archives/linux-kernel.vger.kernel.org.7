The "problem" I'm not understanding is why does the kernel have to do
any of this parsing at all?  What does it do with these segments that
userspace can't do instead?  Why does patching have to be done within
the kernel at all?  What prevents all of this from being done elsewhere?

And ELF parsing is "tricky" in places, and you aren't using the existing
elf parser, as proof of needing a new parser in rust :)
