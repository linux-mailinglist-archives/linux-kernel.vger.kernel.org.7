Hi Youngjun,

Sorry for the late reply, I have been super busy in the last two weeks
and I am still catching up on my backlogs.

Thanks for the patches. I notice that your cover letter does not have
[0/3] on it. One tool I found useful is using the b4 to send out
patches in series. Just for your consideration, it is not an ask. I
can review patches not sent out from b4 just fine.

I think a lot of this documentation nature of the cover letter should
move into a kernel document commit. Maybe
Documentation/mm/swap_tiers.rst

Another suggestion is use "+SSD:100,+HDD:2,-SD" that kind of flavor
similar to "cgroup.subtree_control" interface, which allows adding or
removing cgroups. That way you can add and remove in one line action.

We can add that we suggest allocating a higher priority range for
faster swap devices. That way more swap page faults will likely be
served by faster swap devices.

See above, make the '-SSD, -HDD' similar to the "cgroup.subtree_control"

This belongs to the memory.swap.tiers section.
"" is not a real tier's name. It is just a wide cast to refer to all tiers.

One thing I realize is that, we might need to have per swap tier have
a matching zswap tier. Otherwise when we refer to zswap, there is no
way for the cgroup to select which backing swapfile does this zswap
use for allocating the swap entry.

We can avoid this complexity by providing a dedicated ghost swapfile,
which only zswap can use to allocate swap entries.

All very good questions. Thanks for preparing that.

I really hope not.

I really want to avoid doing the reparenting.
