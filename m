x86_flattree_get_config() is a bit odd in that the DT is mapped and 
unflattened in one shot. Usually the flat DT is mapped and scanned 
early, and then only unflattened once memblock is up. You will be better 
off moving the early mapping and scanning earlier. Then the next thing 
you want from the DT early will be there. For example, the console or 
handling for kexec (which is its own reserved regions).
