You're right, this is a requirement for lazy MMU. Calling enable() then
disable() means returning to the original state, and if the function
sleeps at that point then the caller must not itself enable lazy MMU.

I mixed up that case with the original motivation for pause()/resume(),
which is to temporarily pause any batching. This is considered an
implementation detail and the caller isn't expected to be aware of it,
hence the need for that use-case to work regardless of nesting.

Indeed, pause()/resume() could be used to allow functions that sleep to
be called with lazy MMU enabled. But that's only a hypothetical use-case
for now.

> Or am I missing something regarding your point on pause()/resume()?

Doesn't sound like it :) I'll remove that paragraph from the (already
long) commit message. Thanks!
