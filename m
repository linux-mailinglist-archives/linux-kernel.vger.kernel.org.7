Old licences have been modified, because FSF postal address was changed:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2024-09/msg00000.html
https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/fsf-office-closing-party
https://www.fsf.org/about/contact/mailing

Just "cut and paste" from original sources:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.0.txt
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt

Relevant change: postal address was replaced with an URL.

There are many changes, because the original text from
spdx.org is a bit odd. Maybe an old copy :-?

+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide

 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a

+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 
-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
-   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
-   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
-   you also meet all of these conditions:
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
-   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 
-   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
-      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
 
-   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
-      all third parties under the terms of this License.
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
 
-   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
-      of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
-      facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
-      invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
-      the event an application does not supply such function or table, the
-      facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
-      remains meaningful.
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
 
-   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
-   purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
-   application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
-   application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
-   optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
-   function must still compute square roots.)
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
 
-   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
-   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and
-   can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
-   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
-   the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
-   License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
-   whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
 
-   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-   collective works based on the Library.
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
-   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
-   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
-   scope of this License.
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
 
-3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
-   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
-   they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
-   notices.
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
 
-   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
-   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
-   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
-   Library into a program that is not a library.
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 
-4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
-   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
-   of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
-   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
-   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-   customarily used for software interchange.
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 
-   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
-   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
-   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
-   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
-   source along with the object code.
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 
-5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
-   is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
-   it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
-   is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
-   scope of this License.
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 
-   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
-   an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
-   portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6
-   states terms for distribution of such executables.
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
 
-   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
-   not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
-   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
 
-   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
-   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
-   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
-   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-   work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
 
-   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
-   6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
 
-6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a
-   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
-   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
-   of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
-   for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
-   modifications.
+    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
 
-   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
-   execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
-   notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
-   user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
+    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 
-   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in
-      the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
-      and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
-      complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
-      code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
-      then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
-      Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
-      definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
-      recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
+distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
 
-   b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
-      6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
-      distribution.
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 
-   c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
-      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
-      materials from the same place.
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
 
-   d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
-      or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
-   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
-   must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
-   executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code
-   distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
-   kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
-   unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
-   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
-   of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
-   operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
-   and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
 
-7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
-   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
-   not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
-   provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
-   and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
-   that you do these two things:
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 
-   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
-      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must
-      be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 
-   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
-      of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
-      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
 
-8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
-   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
-   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
-   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
-   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
-   under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
-   such parties remain in full compliance.
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
-9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
-   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
-   the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
-   if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
-   distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you
-   indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
-   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
-   based on it.
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
 
-10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
-    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
-    herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
-    parties to this License.
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
-11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
-    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
-    would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
-    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
-    only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
-    entirely from distribution of the Library.
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
 
-    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-    apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-    circumstances.
+                            NO WARRANTY
 
-    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the

-    choice.
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 
-    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
 
-12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
-    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
-    copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
-    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
-    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
-    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
-    limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 
-13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
-    the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
-    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
-    detail to address new problems or concerns.
-
-    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
-    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-    later version", you have the option of following the terms and
-    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
-    the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
-    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
-    Software Foundation.
-
-14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
-    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
-    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
-    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
-    guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
-    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
-    of software generally.
-
-NO WARRANTY

-    PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
-    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED

-   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

-   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
-      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
 
-   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
-      all third parties under the terms of this License.
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)

+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

-   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If

-   whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library

-   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or

+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 
-   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
-   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
-   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the

+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
 
-3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
-   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
-   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
-   they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
-   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
-   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
-   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
-   notices.
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
 
-   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
-   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
-   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 
-   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
-   Library into a program that is not a library.
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 
-4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
-   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
-   of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
-   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
-   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-   customarily used for software interchange.
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 
-   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
-   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
-   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
-   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
-   source along with the object code.
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 
-5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
-   is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with
-   it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation,
-   is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the
-   scope of this License.
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 
-   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
-   an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
-   portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
-   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6
-   states terms for distribution of such executables.
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
 
-   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
-   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
-   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
-   not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
-   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
-   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
 
-   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
-   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
-   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
-   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
-   work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
-   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
 
-   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
-   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section
-   6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
-   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 
-6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
-   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
-   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
-   of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
-   for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
-   modifications.
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
+    least three years, to give the same user the materials
+    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
+    than the cost of performing this distribution.
 
-   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
-   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
-   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
-   execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
-   notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
-   user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
 
-   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in
-      the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above);
-      and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the
-      complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
-      code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
-      then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
-      Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
-      definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
-      recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 
-   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
-      Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy
-      of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather
-      than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will
-      operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user
-      installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible
-      with the version that the work was made with.
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
 
-   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
-      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
-      6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
-      distribution.
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 
-   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
-      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
-      materials from the same place.
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
 
-   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials
-      or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 
-   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
-   must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
-   executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
-   distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
-   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
-   kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
-   unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 
-   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
-   of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
-   operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
-   and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
 
-7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
-   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities
-   not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,
-   provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library
-   and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided
-   that you do these two things:
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 
-   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
-      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must
-      be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
+and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 
-   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
-      of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
-      the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
 
-8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
-   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
-   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
-   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
-   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
-   under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
-   such parties remain in full compliance.
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
-9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
-   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute
-   the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
-   if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
-   distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you
-   indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
-   conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
-   based on it.
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
+an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
+so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
+excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
+written in the body of this License.
 
-10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
-    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
-    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
-    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
-    herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
-    parties with this License.
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
-11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
-    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
-    would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
-    those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
-    only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
-    entirely from distribution of the Library.
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
 
-    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-    apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-    circumstances.
