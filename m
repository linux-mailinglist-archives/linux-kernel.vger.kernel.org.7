That would be wonderful.

More context may be needed here. Currently, num_mbm_cntrs indicates the
number of counters available per domain, which is 32.

At the moment, we can assign 2 counters to each group, meaning each RMID
can be associated with 2 hardware counters. In theory, it's possible to
assign all 32 hardware counters to a group—allowing one RMID to be linked
with up to 32 counters. However, we currently lack the interface to
support that level of assignment.

For now, the plan is to support basic assignment and expand functionality
later once we have the necessary data structure and requirements.

This series hides the configuration files (mbm_local_bytes_config and
mbm_total_bytes_config) required for BMEC when ABMC is enabled.

When the user switches back to "default" mode, BMEC becomes available
again. I believe it's a good approach to keep it this way.

This is a group-level property—it resides within each group and is not
related to any specific resource.

I’m not sure about the details of how soft-ABMC will be supported. It’s
not available at the moment, but I believe it can be added once soft-ABMC
support is in place.

Yes, that’s correct. The event types (reads, writes, etc.) supported by
both BMEC and ABMC are the same, so I’ve used generalized names here.

As for portability, I can’t comment, since I’m not familiar with how event
configuration is handled in MPAM or other architectures.
