Do you have a theory about why on some platforms, like the one you're
currently adding support for, writing UEFI variables does not work?

Can you please include that information in the series so we can consider
alternate routes for replacing the current whitelist with this black and
white thing you're going for.

Is it related to UFS at all, for example?

A developer enabling support for a new platform can patch the driver and
does not need a command line option.

If you enable it by default, suddenly a bunch of end-users are going to
have to debug why storing efi variables silently fails. That would not
be fair to them.

But this is just kicking the can and putting the burden on someone else.
Now a user or distro would need to pass command line parameters after
spending time debugging why efi variable updates do not persist after a
reboot.

If we know with reasonable certainty that all, say X1E, devices works,
then that that's one thing.

But if this series now enables broken EFI variable support on every
other device then I don't think that's ok (even if you provide a command
line parameter that each user now have to pass).

Then I'd rather see a proposal for how to determine which machines
support this or not, information which was not available when this
interface was reverse engineered and where a conservative whitelist
approach made perfect sense.

I think you meant my sc8280xp CRD here.
