Unfortunately this is sort of beyond our control. We don't expect you to
review or apply these patches immediately.

The platform announcement just happened to occur at this and not any other
time, and we can't just ask the entire company to shift it to better
accommodate the kernel release cycle..

We do have an interest in sharing the work at the earliest time possible,
and with all the legal knots included, this is what it came down to.

I (and many others) made an internal push to upstream any pre-requisite
patches that we didn't need to disclose any platform details for in
advance, so this patchbomb is actually somewhat reduced.. but of course
DT and bindings are the main course size-wise and we simply couldn't do
it earlier.

Give or take 80% of the bindings will be "boring", i.e. "add compatbile"
or "add compatible and adjust clocks" because our hw is rather
standardized and the interesting changes often happen at a level beyond
bindings

Perhaps this would be useful to have in bindings commit messages, but
the cover letter of >this< series states that Kaanapali is the newly
announced Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.

The product page states at the very bottom of the spec sheet that
SM8850 is another name for it (although the shift to codenames
happened precisely to disconnect from specific SKU numbers,
because e.g. both SA8775P and QCS9100 are 'lemans' silicon)
