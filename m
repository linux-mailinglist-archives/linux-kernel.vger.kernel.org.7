Yes. We do sometimes link to other function for safety requirements if
they are very repetitive, but in that case we use a rustdoc link (so
[`my_other_function`]).

In this case, one doesn't even have a name to search for, only the
`fwnode_property_read_` prefix (and who is going to bother doing that?).
Additionally, the functions that you are referring to are from the
`bindings`! Those functions do not have safety documentation!

Another thing, functions do not have safety invariants, they only have
safety requirements and guarantees.

Yes these two are probably required, but to be sure one would have to
dig through the C code.

Yes this is correct, I don't think that the trait itself should be
unsafe.

Yes that sounds like a good idea.

I'll send a separate email for some more comments on the design.
