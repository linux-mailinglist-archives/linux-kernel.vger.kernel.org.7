So just let users ensure that they always match each `enable` call with
a `disable` call in the `Dynamic` typestate?

That is ok, if no memory issues can arise from forgetting to do so,
otherwise those functions need to be `unsafe`. Also we should clearly
document that the `Enabled`/`Disabled` typestates should be preferred if
possible.
