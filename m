Why does the first succeed and the second fail?  Don't they have the
same SAMPLE_READ and SAMPLE_TID + inherit flags?

The missing feature check is about the global kernel behavior so there's
no point to try if we know the kernel won't support those features.
While precise fallback is per-PMU (and per-event?) behavior so it'd be
natural to try that after removing must-fail attributes from the missing
feature tests.
