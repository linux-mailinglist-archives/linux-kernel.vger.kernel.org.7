Hi,

I will post a patch soon then. I just got my hands on the CI machine where the test failed
and yes, the machine receives about 8 #SMIs per second on each core. Oh well...

BTW pmu_counters_test selftest is also affected since it counts # of retired instructions.
With #SMI getting in the way, the number of course soars.

It doesn't fail often at this rate but it does when the test test is done for sufficient
number or times or you just get lucky.


Best regards,
