Looks to me like AMD wasn't even supported til v10.8.0 (2024-10-01)[1].

Is that even applied yet?

Fair enough, but I'd be rather surprised if there doesn't end up being
changes to support Arm platforms.

What about using the logical CPU number instead? That's stable for a
given machine and firmware. And then instead of having 3 sets of
numbers (MPIDR, compressed MPIDR, and logical CPU), we'd still only
have 2. And logical CPU is what sysfs already exposes to userspace.
