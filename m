I think the IOCTL based API and then a userspace tool that can use these
sounds good for now.

As for this series, I would support the motion to move this to debugFS.
Similar to how we have /sys/kernel/debug/scmi/0/raw ...
I think grouping telemetry too under the same debug/ interface makes more
sense to me.

To my knowledge, I don't see that many users of firmware based telemetry similar to how
SCMI telemetry is being proposed. So maybe at the moment a whole new
telemetry subsystem might be an overkill.

Perhaps in the future...

As a user, having used hwmon in the past, and also looking at the SCMI spec example
of capturing the output of a sensor which measures the temperature of a PE

Here's some points that support that:

* HWMON is a well-established interface for exposing sensor data (temperature,
voltage, current, power, etc.) to userspace via sysfs.

* Many userspace tools (e.g., lm-sensors, monitoring dashboards) already 
understand HWMON.

* Well-known/architected SCMI DEs (like temperature, voltage, power)
directly map to HWMON sensor types.

However I can see that we may hit a limitation with that with the amount
of flexibility in SCMI telemetry, it may not always fit well in hwmon.

But, I think we can still leverage hwmon for telemetry related to power/
sensor related info.

The question about how do we differentiate between the above subsystems
is still open. Do we expect telemetry to purely come from the firmware
once the kernel is booted up already and is limited in the scope of what
it knows about the system its running on?
Or, can we somehow use DT to specify the subsystem we are interested in
based on the telemetry "number" and some compatible?
