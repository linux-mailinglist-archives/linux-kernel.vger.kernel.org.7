I see, thank you.

As you explain it, it does not sound as though calculating how many
RMIDs can be supported is required to be done in rdt_get_tree(), but doing
so would make the implementation more robust since doing so does not rely
on assumptions about what hardware can and will support.

I get this now. This will require rework of the kernel command line parsing
support since current implementation is so closely integrated with the
X86_FEATURE_* flags (and is perhaps an unexpected architecture specific
portion of resctrl). 
What if "rdt=perf" means that "3" is also included in the computation
of how many monitor groups are supported? That would help users to not
need to limit the number of simultaneous active RMIDs.

When comparing to "num_closids" the expectation may be that "num_rmids"
would be accurate for particular resource with understanding that the
minimum among all resources guides the number of monitor groups. This
seems close enough to existing interface to not use this as moment
to move to a new "num_mon_hw_id" or such that works for MPAM also.
