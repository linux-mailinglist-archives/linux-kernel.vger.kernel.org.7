I was about to respond to your reply, but I guess this may be a better
fit for it. The TL;DR: version is this:

If you think distros shouldn't enable it, as you initially clearly
described and it seems to me you still think so, the right thing for
distros to do, is to disable those test. Which in turn means the fast
tests should not be reinstated (?).

I explicitly referenced https://bugs.debian.org/599441 as that was the
only justification I found for enabling it.
In it, on 2010-10-07 "Mario 'BitKoenig' Holbe" said:

  I personally think (re)enabling these tests would be a way safer
  default for a distribution kernel which runs on lots of different
  hardware setups

Before I looked up that bug, I had not heard of that person, so I don't
know if they're a crypto expert or just a random person on the internet.
It also doesn't say *why* they thought it would be a good idea to enable
those tests.
I have no idea what Fedora's reasoning was for enabling it. Maybe their
reasons were sound; I think Debian's are rather thin (that I could
find). And from ~ 15 years ago.

> keep them enabled.  The full set of tests isn't great for that, since

I think the 'new' description is(/was) great. A subject matter expert
says/said "don't enable this on production kernels". I wish all Kconfig
help texts were this clear :-)
So based on the previous description, it seems wise that Debian (and
Fedora) would update their kernel config and disable those test.

In *my* update to 6.16-rc1, I only 'converted' to new names.
A change to my kernel config (ie disable the tests) would be in a
separate commit (with an appropriate commit msg).
I hadn't done that yet as I was curious what the results would be.

So "they seem to want to keep them enabled" seems a premature
conclusion; at least wrt Debian and AFAICT.
It's also possible that if/when people see the kernel warning, they'd
file a new Debian bug to have it disabled.

(I've made some contributions in the past, but) I am not part of
Debian's kernel team, so I don't know what they will decide.

I'll gladly leave it up to you if you still think reinstating the fast
tests is worth it, but I felt a bit more context was warranted.

Cheers,
  Diederik
