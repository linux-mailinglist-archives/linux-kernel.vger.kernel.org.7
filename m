Yeah, but since this filtering would be happening in whatever code
reads those logs, outside of the kernel, we first need to get the
candidate backtraces from the kernel, so having them a log level
appropriate for an unusual event would definitely help.

I was convinced that the soft/hard_lockup detector also does the same,
but I double checked and it seems like it [1] just calls dump_stack()
that uses KERN_DEFAULT and in our case that defaults to 4
(KERN_WARNING), which is more severe than 6 (KERN_INFO) that we want
to filter out, so I guess making the hung task watchdog behave the
same way would also work for us.

[2] https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.14.4/source/lib/dump_stack.c#L127

Besides that, I don't actually have any other cases at hand. I guess
we'll find out once we look at more crash reports.

The problem with the special lines is that it completely breaks any
line-based processing in a data pipeline. For a piece of
infrastructure that needs to deal with thousands of reports, on an
on-demand basis, that would mean quite a bit of sequential work done
instead of doing it in parallel and taking much more time to answer
users' queries.

That could be worked around, though, if we could prefix each line
separately with some special tag in addition to log level, timestamp
and caller, though. Borrowing from Sergey's earlier example:

where [E] would mean an "emergency" message, rather than something
usual, regardless of the loglevel.

Best,
