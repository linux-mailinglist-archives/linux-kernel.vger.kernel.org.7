Have you looked at the wr-protect mode, and UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP for _COPY?

If sync fault is a perf concern for frequent writes, just to mention at
least latest Linux also supports async tracking (UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC),
which is almost exactly soft dirty bits to me, though it solves a few
issues it has on e.g. false positives over vma merging and swapping, or
like you said missing of finer granule reset mechanisms.

Maybe you also want to have a look at the pagemap ioctl introduced some
time ago ("Pagemap Scan IOCTL", which, IIRC was trying to use uffd-wp in
soft-dirty-like way):

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/mm/pagemap.rst

The latter requires all the setups needed, and an useless ioctl to probe.
Not a huge issue, but since userfaultfd is extensible, a feature flag might
be better as long as a new feature is well defined.

Probably not.  I don't see a need to implement something just to make the
API look good..  If any chunk of code in the Linux kernel has no plan to be
used, we should probably not adding them since the start..

Thanks,
