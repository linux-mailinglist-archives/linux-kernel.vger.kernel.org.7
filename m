It does not look like this discussion is going anywhere,
despite 2 drm subsystem maintainers and the simplefb
maintainer telling you that this is what is necessary
and also that we believe this is the right thing todo.

IOW despite 3 domain experts telling you we want this,
you keep coming up with vague, not really technical
argument about this not being generic / simple enough.

Looking at this from a driver pov interconnects are just
another resource we need to avoid from turning off.

And this is simple and generic, the actual display-engine
drivers are very complex and when powering things up
this needs to be done in a very specific order with
specific delays. That is hw-specific. The simplefb/simpledrm
code does not need any of this knowledge everything is
already setup. The simple* drivers just needs to claim all
listed resources in an arbitrary order and without any delays
as someone who has written many many drivers this is
about as simple and generic as it can get.

But as mentioned it looks like this discussion is going
anywhere. Is there some sort of arbitration / appeal
process which we can use when DT-maintainers block
a binding which has been acked and is seen as necessary
by the subsystem maintainers of the subsystem for which
the bindings are ?

Regards,

Hans
