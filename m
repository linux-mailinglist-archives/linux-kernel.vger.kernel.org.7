Sorry about the bad example, I got confused looking at the wrong code
base and deduced a wrong stack. Before this series it was returning
entry_order here so yeah it's OK.

The problem is, could split_order be 0 while getting a large folio,
which is like the problem in patch 1.
This patch changed the race window by a lot, even if that happens,
shmem_split_swap_entry will just fail and retry though.

Or, can it get a split_order !=3D 0 while folio order =3D=3D 0:

So assume we do (check split_order instead, trimming all comments):
if (order > folio_order(folio)) {
    split_order =3D shmem_split_swap_entry(inode, index, swap, gfp);
    if (split_order < 0)
        goto failed_nolock;
    if (split_order > 0) {
        offset =3D index - round_down(index, 1 << split_order);
        swap =3D swp_entry(swp_type(swap), swp_offset(swap) + offset);
        /* Could we get unnecessary `folio->swap !=3D swap`? */
    } else {
        /* Do we need any rounding here? */
        /* eg. swap.val =3D round_down(swap.val, 1 << folio_order(folio)) *=
/
        /* Could be helpful */
    }
} else if (order < folio_order(folio)) {
    swap.val =3D round_down(swap.val, 1 << folio_order(folio));
}

I was scratching my head in the midnight to figure out if we
need a round down in the /* Do we need any rounding here */ part.

And it seems, we don't? There could be a lot of races, but because
shmem_split_swap_entry is now actually
guarded by swap cache (or swap_map's HAS_CACHE) now: to split an
index, we must load the folio in the swap cache (or the HAS_CACHE bit)
first now. So if a large folio is loaded here, the underlying entries
must remain un-splitted, as it prevents any parallel swapin for
entries is covered.

But this also requires us to call shmem_split_swap_entry with the
right swap and index value covered by the folio (if not, it's still
OK, just redundant split or redundant fault in the worst case it
seems, this clean up can be done later instead).

But there is still a missing issue that I posted previously, it really
should do a ealy fixup of the swap entry for the cached swapin in this
patch (it's delayed to the final patch in this series):

So the shmem_swapin_cluster call should be:

/* Cached swapin currently only supports order 0 swapin */
offset =3D index - round_down(index, 1 << order);
folio =3D shmem_swapin_cluster(swp_entry(swp_type(swap),
swp_offset(swap) + offset), gfp, info, index);

So far I think it's enough for this patch now. I can send a V4 to
keep this part's change as minimized as possible, but in later commits
things may still have to change a bit... especially for avoiding
redundant calculation of offset and swap, or minimizing the overhead,
ensuring shmem_split_swap_entry is called with the right value to
avoid re-faults.

I'll try my best to keep this part as unchanged as possible, but I do find =
it
somehow harder to track as the swapin path gets more refactors.

My bad for making it confusing in the first place, the patches are
still not very well-splitted enough for easier reviewing I think,
please have my apologies if this is causing any inconvenience for you.
