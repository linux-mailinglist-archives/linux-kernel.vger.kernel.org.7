Hi Zhongkun,

Thanks for a very detailed and awesome description of the problem. This
is a real issue and we at Meta face similar scenarios as well. However I
would not go for PF_MEMALLOC_ACFORCE approach as it is easy to abuse and
is very manual and requires detecting the code which can cause such
scenarios and then case-by-case opting them in. I would prefer a dynamic
or automated approach where the kernel detects such an issue is
happening and recover from it. Though a case can be made where we avoid
such scenarios from happening but that might not be possible everytime.

Also this is very memcg specific, I can clearly see the same scenario
can happen for global reclaim as well.

I have a couple of questions below:

This breaks memory.max semantics. Any reason memory.high is not used
here. Basically instead of memory.max, use memory.high as job limit. I
would like to know how memory.high is lacking for your use-case. Maybe
we can fix that or introduce a new form of limit. However this is memcg
specific and will not resolve the global reclaim case.

Can you explain a bit more about jbd2 handler? Is it some global shared
lock or a workqueue which can only run single thread at a time.
Basically is there a way to get the current holder/owner of jbd2 handler
programmatically?

What is the kernel version? Can you run scripts/gfp-translate on the
gfp_mask above? Does this kernel have a75ffa26122b ("memcg, oom: do not
bypass oom killer for dying tasks")?

Is there a way to get how many times this thread has looped within
try_charge_memcg()?

This is unexpected and most probably our hacks to allow overcharge to
avoid similar situations are causing this.

Oh oom reaper didn't help?

OOM reaper usually helps in such cases but I see below why it didn't
help.

The following thread has mmap_lock in write mode and thus oom-reaper is
not helping. Do you see "oom_reaper: unable to reap pid..." messages in
dmesg?

Can you please confirm the above? Is the kernel able to oom-kill more
processes or if it is returning early because the current thread is
dying. However if the cgroup has just one big process, this doesn't
matter.

I already explained upfront why this is not the approach we want.

We do see similar situations/scenarios but due to global/shared locks in
btrfs but I expect any global lock or global shared resource can cause
such priority inversion situations.
