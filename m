... so that is a good point ...
...thanks Peng for pointing out this first of all...

So, in general all of these counters are per-instance, we don't have any
finer per-channel granularity....we could in the future split them out
to be per-channel counters, but I wonder if it would be worth the
effort: because, as I see it, errors reported by these counters are more
of a alarm-bell than a triage tool, in the sense that I would expect
that seeing a lot of errors of some kind on an instance should just act
as a warning that something is NOT right somewhere, so that you can
investigate further by enabling the already existent and more comprehensive
SCMI trace events to fully inveestigate the problem...since SCMI full event
traces DO also include the used-channel beside a lot of other info about
the xfer transactions.

Moreover, in the specific case of tracking inflight xfers, note that
the counter added in this series tracks the pool of xfers allocated in
tx_minfo(A2P) free-lists (i.e. commands...P2A msgs hardly can be lost),
BUT this structure is per-instance (NOT per-channel), so even if you had
say a few more dedicated per-protocol channels defined on a system,
all the A2P transactions will pick their xfers from the same per-instance
pool... (..because the max_inflights is meant to cap the maximum number
of outstanding transactions that the server has to cope with...)

Thanks,
Cristian
