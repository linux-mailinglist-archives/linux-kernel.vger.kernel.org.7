Agreed. Using phys_addr_t for paddr is the right approach—unsigned long
was incorrect for physical addresses.

Since memory ranges vary across systems, different scaling factors would
be needed. This could increase maintenance complexity.

Agreed. Some prototype testing would be helpful to evaluate overhead,
especially in extreme cases with large numbers of regions.

Glad you found them helpful!

You're right, this method is not the only option.

Sounds good! Please share the prototype when ready - happy to test and
help improve it.
