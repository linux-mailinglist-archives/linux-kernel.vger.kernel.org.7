I don't think that will happen.  I suspect it may have a timing issue
like two threads are racing to setup BPF for syscall tracing and
setting up the second thread's BPF will disable the first one for a
short amount of time.  And 'mv' runs very shortly so it finished while
it's disabled.  But it's just a wild guess.
