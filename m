Here's mobile client profile:

https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM_2.0_Mobile_Common_Profile_v2r31_FINAL.pdf

Unless I missed a tidbit I see nothing in it saying that ContextSave
would be optional. If there was even a known legit spec bringing some
context to the claims, that would move things forward.

Section 2.3 states this about ContextSave:

"The symmetric cipher mode TPM_ALG_CFB is REQUIRED by TCG TPM 2.0
Library specification Part 1 [1] and is also necessary for
implementation of TPM2_Create, TPM2_Load, TPM 2_ContextSave,
TPM2_ContextLoad, and other TPM commands"

which actually claims that TPM_ALG_CFB is required where as Chris'
patch claims 180 degrees opposite what the spec says.

Perhaps there's some other random TCG spec that I've missed, it's
entirely possible...
