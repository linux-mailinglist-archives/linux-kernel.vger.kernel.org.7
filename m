That email was not threaded, and also not obvious what was going on, so
I long deleted it from my review queue.

Ah, that was not obvious at all.  Remember, some of us get thousands of
emails a day to review, please make things that you are submitting for
non-mainline kernels very very very obvious as to what is going on.

For a staging driver, it's not an issue, don't worry about it, no distro
should be using it anyway as no one has the hardware :)
