Ask hardware team what is necessary to implement given IP in an SoC. SoC
architectures are not that simple, that you copy&paste some piece of
VHDL code and it plugs into existing wiring. You need that wiring, you
need that SoC specific bits in your design.

I don't talk about driver. We talk about hardware and bindings.

Do you understand the problem discussed here? There is a long standing
policy, based on actual real hardware and real cases, that you cannot
have generic compatibles for custom IP blocks. That's it.

So some sort of FPGA in some sort of setup which you claim with this
patch is exactly the same for every other SoC. That is the meaning of
your patch, to which I objected.

We are not even talking here about drives. I do not have to provide you
answers for drivers.

I explained already what I expect from bindings: real hardware
description, so either real SoC or whatever you are having there.

How? How can you fix a sent v2 with the same issues I pointed out before?
