Right.  We _could_ block such a configuration from reaching the hardware,
if the arch backend overrides the MIN limit when the MAX limit is
written and vice-versa, when not doing to would result in crossed-over
bounds.

If software wants to program both bounds, then that would be fine: in:

# cat <<-EOF >/sys/fs/resctrl/schemata
	MB_MAX: 0=128
EOF

# cat <<-EOF >/sys/fs/resctrl/schemata
	MB_MIN: 0=256
	MB_MAX: 0=1024
EOF

... internally programming some value >=256 before programming the
hardware with the new min bound would not stop the final requested
change to MB_MAX from working as userspace expected.

(There will be inevitable regulation glitches unless the hardware
provides a way to program both bounds atomically.  MPAM doesn't; I
don't think RDT does either?)


But we only _need_ to do this if the hardware architecture forbids
programming cross bounds or says that it is unsafe to do so.  So, I am
thinking that the generic code doesn't need to handle this.

Agreed -- it works either way.

I guess I'll go with this approach, then, and see if anyone objects.

To avoid printing entries in the wrong order, do we want to track some
parent/child relationship between schemata.

In the above example,

	* MB is the parent of MB_HW;

	* MB_HW is the parent of MB_MIN and MB_MAX.

(for MPAM, at least).

When schemata is read, parents should always be printed before their
child schemata.  But really, we just need to make sure that the
rdt_schema_all list is correctly ordered.


Do you think that this relationship needs to be reported to userspace?

Since the "#" convention is for backward compatibility, maybe we should
not use this for new schemata, and place the burden of managing
conflicts onto userspace going forward.  What do you think?

OK -- note, I don't think we have any immediate plan to support this in
the MPAM driver, but it may land eventually in some form.

OK; I suggest that we put this on one side, for now, then.

There is a discussion to be had on this, but it feels like a separate
thing.


I'll try to pull the state of this discussion together -- maybe as a
draft update to the documentation, describing the interface as proposed
so far.  Does that work for you?

Cheers
