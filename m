In your tests, I don't agree 50% error because your
assumption that process benefit equals pages_sharing is fundamentally flawed.

The issue lies in what is the most accurate definition of process KSM profit.
Since stable_node isn't per-mm, we cannot calculate a process's
benefit solely based on pages_sharing. The cost of stable_node should be split
fairly among every process sharing this stable_node, rather than being assigned
to a single individual.

It's inaccurate to claim that when two processes' pages merge into a
single KSM page, one process gains 4k - sizeof(rmap_item) while
the other gains 0 ? This is unfair to the second process, as it actively
participated in the KSM merge.


The most accurate and fair profit caculation should be:

    profit = (ksm_merging_pages - united_stable_nodes)*PAGE_SIZE - sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

where 'united_stable_nodes' is (stable_node)/shared_process. This is too complex.

For example: process A with one page is merged with process B with one page

process A      process B
    page          page
     \           /
      \         /
       \       /
        \     /
        Ksm Page

A: pages_sharing(1), pages_shared(0)
B: pages_sharing(0), pages_shared(1)

then

profit(A) = (pages_sharing + pages_shared - united_stable_nodes)*4K- sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

          = (1 + 0 - 1/2)*4k-sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

          = 0.5*4k - sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

profit(A) = (pages_sharing + pages_shared - united_stable_nodes)*4K- sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

	  = (0 + 1 - 1/2)*4k-sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items

          = 0.5*4k - sizeof(rmap_items)*ksm_rmap_items
