Then I recommend doing this, thanks.

With the exception of the "set the fuse issue", I really don't see why
sending a bunch of small firmware files through the kernel to the
hardware is any harder to do in userspace vs. within the kernel itself.
Either way you have to do the "parsing" and splitting up, it's just
generally safer to do all of that in userspace instead.

But you all have a beast of a device to control, odds are this is one of
the only tiny minor issues involved with that overall :)
