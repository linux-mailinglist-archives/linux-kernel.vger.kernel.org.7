What I think I think it is good call.

True, I agree with this.

After reading this email I realized also another issue with these patch
when I tested them sequentially building a VM for each commit ID.

Without "tpm: Require O_EXCL for exclusive /dev/tpm access" applied,
there's a regression: usually a daemon of some sort opens /dev/tpm0:

COMMAND      PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
tpm2-abrm 771444  tss    5u   CHR 10,224      0t0   94 /dev/tpm0

Without top patch this leaves /dev/tpmrm0 unusuable, which is a huge
developer experience downgrade as it is nice and covenient device
to try and do things. I.e. tail patch needs to be squashed and
the whole patch set needs to be re-reviewed.

I don't know systemd source code too well, but after eading
documentation of systemd-cryptenroll, it can also use /dev/tpmrm0:

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-cryptenroll.html

Based on this it's now like there's a breaking patch and the top
most patch fixes the bug.

And based on this I'm happy to postpone O_EXCL changes to 6.19.
Patch set just needs to be restructured better so that in-the
middle of the series patches don't break things. And also it'd
be better if this patch would be relocated as the first in the
series: "tpm: Remove tpm_find_get_ops".

Not disagreeing with this.

'll send tomorrow a new PR without O_EXCL patches.

As per hmac encryption, I think my decision was the right call
but cover letter did suck agreed (sorry about that).
