They're good for individual counters but I'm not sure they're natural fit
for a group of stats. A series of atomic ops can be significantly more
expensive than locked updates and it also comes with problems like split
updates as discussed in this thread. I think most of resistance is from the
use of atomics. Can you please try a different approach?

Yeah, I saw the benchmark but I was more curious what actual use case would
lead to behaviors like that because you'd have to hammer on those stats
really hard for this to be a problem. In most use cases that I'm aware of,
the polling frequencies of these stats are >= 1sec. I guess the users in
your use case were banging on them way harder, at least previously.

I don't think switching to atomics is a good idea, but improving the read
scalability would definitely be nice.

Thanks.
