Sure, I left them alone as they were already mismatched...

Sure,

I was curious how kernel-doc would resolves references like that - turns out its just
formatting.

Yup. This was just left as is as its the existing behaviour.

Fixed.

Heh, this is because I go back and add 'struct' before structure names as a second pass.

Done!

Its suitably descriptive and doesn't cause a line length problems. Done.

I've tacked "for the same event in the same domain" on the end, otherwise
it reads like there is a single set of values.

Fixed,

Done,

I'll change these to 'event file', which at least matches the earlier comments.
