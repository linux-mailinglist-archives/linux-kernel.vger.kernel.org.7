Ah thanks I missed that when I moved the PTE unmapping to out_up_write.

Can you please share how you reproduce the bug? I haven't been able to
reproduce any BUGs with most of the memory debuggers enabled. This has
also been through a number of mm test suites and some internal
testing. So i'm curious how to hit this issue!

Hmm if I understand this correctly, the check you are adding is
already being handled in the PMD case through
thp_vma_suitable_order(s) (by checking that a PMD can fit in the VMA
@address); however, I think you are correct, we much check that the
VMA still spans the whole PMD region we are trying to a mTHP collapse
within it... if not its possible that a mremap+mmap might have occured
allowing a different mapping to belong to the same PMD (this also
makes support mTHP collapse in mappings <PMD sized difficult and is
the reason we haven't pursued it yet, the locking requires explode,
the simple solutions is as you noted, only support <PMD sized
collapses with a single VMA in the PMD range, this is a future
change).

I actually realized my revalidation is rather weak... mostly because
I'm passing the PMD address, not the mTHP starting address (see
address vs _address in collapse_huge_page). I think your check would
be handled if I pass it _address. If that was the case the following
check would be performed in thp_vma_suitable_order:

if (haddr < vma->vm_start || haddr + hpage_size > vma->vm_end)
return false;

Sadly I dont have a good answer for you as mmu_notifier is mostly a
mystery to me too. I assume the anon_vma_lock_write would prevent any
others from touching the pages we ARE NOT invalidating here, and that
may be enough. Honestly I think the anon_vma_lock_write allows up to
remove a lot of the locking (but as i stated im trying to keep the
locking the  *same* in this series).

The reason for leaving it in the mTHP case was to prevent the
aforementioned GUP-fast race.
* Parallel GUP-fast is fine since GUP-fast will back off when
* it detects PMD is changed.

I tried to keep the same locking principles as the PMD case: remove
the PMD, hold all the same locks, collapse to (m)THP, reinstall the
PMD. This seems the easiest way to get it right and allowed me to
focus on adding the feature. The codebase being scattered with
mentions of potential races, and taking locks that might not be
needed, also made me weary.

I know Dev was looking into optimizations for the locking, and I have
some ideas of ways to improve it, or at least clean up some of the
locking.

I believe the current approach with your anon_write_unlock fix would
suffice (if the gup race is a valid reason to keep the pmd flush), and
then we can follow up with locking improvements.

Yes I believe a lot of locking can be improved and some is unnecessary.

This is what the revalidate func is doing with
khugepaged_test_exit_or_disable so I tried to keep it consistent.
Sadly this was the cleanest solution I could come up with. If you dont
mind sharing what your solution to this was, I'd be happy to take a
look!

I agree its use is confusing and I like to think of it as ONLY the
indicator of it being locked/unlocked. Im not sure if there were other
intended uses.
