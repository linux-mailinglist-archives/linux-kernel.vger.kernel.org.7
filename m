root@number:~#

So the behaviour if "instructions" is specified, since perf started, is
to have this:

     0.030 ( 0.004 ms): :620592/620592 perf_event_open(attr_uptr: { type: 0 (PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE), size: 136, config: 0x1 (PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS), sample_type: IDENTIFIER, read_format: TOTAL_TIME_ENABLED|TOTAL_TIME_RUNNING, disabled: 1, inherit: 1 }, pid: -1, cpu: 1, group_fd: -1, flags: FD_CLOEXEC) = 8

And this is what we continue to obtain.

At some point we started supporting sysfs/JSON and then INSTRUCTIONS
started being accepted and we are getting:

     0.000 ( 0.025 ms): :620592/620592 perf_event_open(attr_uptr: { type: 4 (cpu), size: 136, config: 0xc0 (instructions), sample_type: IDENTIFIER, read_format: TOTAL_TIME_ENABLED|TOTAL_TIME_RUNNING, disabled: 1, inherit: 1 }, pid: -1, cpu: 1, group_fd: -1, flags: FD_CLOEXEC) = 3

Which is what is expected, no change in behaviour over time.
