 I don't feel like I'm the right person to talk about such stuff.  I've 
always cared about portability and standardisation.

 In fact running old hardware is one aspect of portability verification, 
for example I run PCIe stuff off my Pentium MMX and Alpha hardware, and 
conversely I run conventional PCI stuff off my POWER9 (no port I/O!) and 
RISC-V hardware.  That has triggered numerous bugs, fixed over the years.

 Well, my i486 box is plain EISA, so naturally I need EISA support to run 
it:

platform eisa.0: Probing EISA bus 0
eisa 00:00: EISA: Mainboard AEI0401 detected
eisa 00:05: EISA: slot 5: DEC3002 detected
defxx: v1.12 2021/03/10  Lawrence V. Stefani and others
00:05: DEFEA at I/O addr = 0x5000, IRQ = 10, Hardware addr = 00-00-f8-xx-yy-zz
00:05: registered as fddi0
eisa 00:06: EISA: slot 6: NPI0303 detected
eisa 00:08: EISA: slot 8: TCM5094 detected
eth0: 3c5x9 found at 0x8000, 10baseT port, address 00:a0:24:xx:yy:zz, IRQ 12.
platform eisa.0: EISA: Detected 3 cards

(fddi0 is the fast intranet interface, eth0 is the slow external one).  
It's a luggable integrated computer BTW, a Dolch PAC 60, very nice and 
compact, previously used by a field engineer for network fault isolation.

 I've already mentioned the maintenance of the defxx driver (it is also an 
exercise in portability, with defxx supporting 3 host bus attachments).

 This is also my backup box for GNU toolchain (GCC/glibc/GDB) verification 
for the i386 target.  It has actually proved recently to still have some 
commercial relevance (again, for portability verification), but who says 
the use of Linux is supposed to be solely commercial even nowadays?

 The origin of Linux is obvious and I wouldn't be around at all let alone 
for so many years if not for my enthusiasm solely for the technical merit 
of Linux (following my earlier passion for processors and systems) 
accompanied by the fairness of the GNU GPL, with any commercial aspect 
being at most distantly relevant and a late comer into the game.

 So yes, count me in as a passionate systems software engineer with a 
fondness for running odd configurations for the sake of experimentation 
(and consequently a portability exercise) and please do not deprive me of 
my enthusiasm.
