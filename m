Sure, I was just highlighting this limitation in the current
implementation...

...and the fact that even if you want to avoid matching on SoC
compatible, the current implementation seems to be too limited to allow
matching on machine compatibles generally (i.e. given that there may be
variants of a particular machine).

We may not even need this for the FC quirk, this was just a general
observation.

It would be more flexible, even if you never intend to accept any quirks
that matches for an entire SoC.

If a vendor truly only cares about some other OS then perhaps this
argument isn't that strong and we'll just increase our own maintenance
burden.

My understanding is that the version has been bumped now albeit for
other reasons than fixing this particular bug. And since enabling FC for
these messages should be safe we will probably be able to match on
vendor/impl_version here.

Sibi is looking into this and should be able to provide an answer
shortly.
