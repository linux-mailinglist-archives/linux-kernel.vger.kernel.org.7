They would accept the same wrapped keys, I think.  But that is theoretical,
since multiple ufs-qcom hosts are currently unsupported for other reasons.

We have to forward derive_sw_secret anyway, since that's invoked by the
filesystem, not by the ioctls.

The other operations are for the ioctls, but I don't see a reason to make things
harder for userspace by forcing userspace to implement logic like:

    if (is_dm(blkdev))
        blkdev = underlying_device(blkdev)
    ioctl(blkdev)

The device-mapper block device has a blk-crypto profile that declares wrapped
key support.  We should just make the ioctls work on that block device, so that
upper layers don't need to care whether it's device-mapper or native.
