Yes, valid concern.

Agreed. I noticed RCU has special handling and I skipped "RCU stall"
case in this patchset on purpose :)

Yes. And for the global knob, my thought is it's 0 (disabled) by
default, which equals doing nothing. And its user should be
experienced developers who knows precisely what information they
need, and set it runtime or by kernel command line. 

For 'panic_print' which we used frequently in bug chasing, we still
let it be 0 even in our debug version kernel, and only enable it
in debugging.

As for the patch set, I tried to not change existing behavior, and
just added option for user to get more info when needed.

IIUC,  ftrace_dump_one() will turn off the tracing during dump, and
should be safe.

Yes.

I agree with you that more is not always better, it should be based
on real needs, case by case.

Thanks for involving more people and sharing the link.
