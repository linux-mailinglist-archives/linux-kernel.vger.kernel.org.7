I don't think there is a *compelling* reason. This came about from Suzuki's
feedback at [1]. He was keen to have a mechanism to disable BBML2 in case issues
were found.

But simpler is usually better; I'd be ok with removing.

Fair enough. This originated based on a similar argument to above. Let's just
remove then.

Will ask Miko to fix.

We are trying to solve for the case where the boot CPU has BBML2 but a secondary
CPU doesn't. (e.g. hetrogeneous system where boot CPU is big and secondary is
little and does not advertise the feature. I can't remember if we proved there
are real systems with this config - I have vague recollection that we did but my
memory is poor...).

My understanding is that for ARM64_CPUCAP_BOOT_CPU_FEATURE, "If the boot CPU
has enabled this feature already, then every late CPU must have it". So that
would exclude any secondary CPUs without BBML2 from coming online?

Suzuki guided us towards this solution.

How do you see this working with ARM64_CPUCAP_BOOT_CPU_FEATURE? Or do you just
think that all systems will always be homogeneous with respect to FEAT_BBM?

Thanks,
Ryan
