On the IWB driver code that I could not post I noticed that it is
true that the .prepare callback is called on a per-interrupt basis
but the vector size is the domain size (ie number of wires) which
is correct AFAICS, so the ITT size should be fine I don't get why
it would need to grow.

The difference with this series is that on v3 LPIs are allocated
on .prepare(), we allocate them on .alloc().

So yes, calling .prepare on a per-interrupt basis looks like a bug
but if we allow reusing a deviceID (ie the "shared" thingy) it could
be harmless.

To be honest, it was expected. We found these snags while designing
the code (that explains how IWB was structured in v1 - by the way)
but we didn't know if the behaviour above was by construction, we
always thought "we must be making a mistake".

The same goes for the fixed eventID but I would not resume that
discussion again, there are things that are impossible to
know unless you are aware of the background story behind them.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
