This was extensively tested on an older Android kernel with real devices.
As you know, running the latest mm-unstable on phones is challenging due
to hardware driver constraints. However, I believe the reported percentage
is accurate, since it seems pointless for userspace heaps to free memory
across two or more VMAs. How could it possibly manage a slab-like system
spanning multiple VMAs?

I=E2=80=99ve definitely considered refactoring madvise_lock, madvise_do_beh=
avior,
and madvise_unlock to encapsulate the details of the per-VMA locking and
mmap_lock handling within those functions:
madvise_lock(mm, behavior);
madvise_do_behavior(mm, start, len_in, behavior);
madvise_unlock(mm, behavior);

However, I=E2=80=99m a bit concerned that this approach might make the code=
 messier
by introducing extra arguments to handle different code paths. For instance=
,
madvise_do_behavior might need an additional parameter to determine whether
VMA traversal via madvise_walk_vmas is necessary.

That said, I=E2=80=99ll give it a try and see if it actually turns out to b=
e as ugly
as I fear.
