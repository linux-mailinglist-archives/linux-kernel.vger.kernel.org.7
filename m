I wonder how Windows drivers handle this.

The ability to use the UTMI clock sounds more appropriate for when only 
a legacy USB2 device is plugged in and the entirety of QMPPHY is 
unnecessary and can be shut down to save power.

BTW I'm still seeing USB2 functionality die if I boot with the monitor 
cable *already* plugged in, but that sounds like a very different issue 
(the host controller starting to touch the bus before the PIPE clock is 
up? something something probe order?)

Hmm. Is it unused? Oh, you mean the pm_runtime_forbid(), right.

Do you have any pointers about what exactly is broken there? I've been 
poking at the runtime PM stuff too 
(https://gitlab.com/Linaro/arm64-laptops/linux/-/issues/14 for USB), the 
PHYs are the biggest missing piece there overall..

Sure, nice catch. Will send a V2 with this fixed.
