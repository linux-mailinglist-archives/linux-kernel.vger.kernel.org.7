OK, the v3 patches already handled page table allocation failure with 
returning -ENOMEM and BUG_ON if it is not mapped because kernel assumes 
linear mapping should be always present. It is easy to return -EINVAL 
instead of BUG_ON. However I'm wondering what usecases you are thinking 
about? Splitting vmalloc area may run into unmapped VA?

Yeah, makes sense to me.

OK, so the new __change_memory_common() will change the permission of 
page table, right? If I remember correctly, you suggested change 
permissions in __create_pgd_mapping_locked() for v3. So I can disregard it?

The current code assumes the address range passed in by 
change_memory_common() is *NOT* physically contiguous so 
__change_memory_common() handles page table permission on page basis. 
I'm supposed Dev's patches will handle this then my patch can safely 
assume the linear mapping address range for splitting is physically 
contiguous too otherwise I can't keep large mappings inside the range. 
Splitting vmalloc area doesn't need to worry about this.

Yes, when repainting I need to split the page table all the way down to 
PTE level. A simple flag should be good enough to tell 
__create_pgd_mapping_locked() do the right thing off the top of my head.

Great! Anyway my series is based on his advertising BBML2 patch.

OK, I just need to add some simple tweak to split down to PTE level to v3.

>    - Integrate Dev's __change_memory_common() series

OK, I think I have to do my patches on top of it. Because Dev's patch 
need guarantee the linear mapping address range is physically contiguous.

Sure.

Definitely makes sense to me.

If I remember correctly, we still have some unsolved comments/questions 
for v3 in my replies on March 17, particularly:
