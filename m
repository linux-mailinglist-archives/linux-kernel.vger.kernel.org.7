I've not argued against the idea, this patch series and many prior
have been put upon to add quirks for the sake of a certain vendor's
PMU drivers having events named the same as legacy events and them
being too belligerent to rename them. I don't want supporting vendor
PMU event naming quirks to cause things to be more complicated than is
absolutely necessary. The key part of this series to me is:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250923223312.238185-18-irogers@google.com/
that is removing 362 lines of the parsing logic. Doing this but
filling the rest of the code base up with new special cases isn't
achieving the simplicity, consistency, .. that I'm hoping for. It is
bad enough that there is a major change to perf record's behavior in
the series, I expect complaints about this :-(

I'm not sure why you are seeing a difference of behavior between v3
and v6 given the code you are testing didn't change. I'm wondering if
a different change in the tree is the issue. Doing a quick comparison
between v6.12 perf and perf-tools-next running not as root and using
an uncore event I see:
```
$ perf --version
perf version 6.12.35
$ perf stat -e data_read true

Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

  <not supported> MiB  data_read:u

      0.001779459 seconds time elapsed

$ /tmp/perf/perf --version
perf version 6.17.rc6.gd18020cf1e92
$ /tmp/perf/perf stat -e data_read true
Error:
The sys_perf_event_open() syscall returned with 22 (Invalid argument)
for event (data_read:u).
"dmesg | grep -i perf" may provide additional information.
```
with the behavior with these patches matching that of perf-tools-next.
I'll dig into this but I'm off in the weeds tracking down issues for
the sake of a certain vendor again and failing to land clean up.

Fwiw, I don't think there's any chance of this making it into v6.18
but getting it into perf-tools-next for an eventual v6.19 would mean
we can work through teething issues.

Thanks,
Ian
