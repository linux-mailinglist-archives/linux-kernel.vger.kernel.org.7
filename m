Overall, the alignment looks good. Among the three points you suggested,
I agree with (3) cgroup inheritance. I would like to continue the
discussion on (1) swap tier lifecycle and (2) allocation logic.

1. swap tier lifecycle
2. allocation logic
3. cgroup inheritance

Yes, I agree that add/remove semantics can be supported,
But it was not fully clear whether there was agreement on the full set
format, I wanted to state explicitly that my preference is to require
the full set format for simplicity. That said, if staged insertion and
removal are considered useful, one possible approach is:

(side note! explanation of the interface was somewhat
descriptive, which may not have been fully clear. If this explanation is
sufficient to establish the general direction, I will aim to present it
more concretely in the patch series. Otherwise, I can provide a more
detailed explanation in a follow-up email.)

  echo "add ssd:100,hdd:50,network_swap" >/sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers
  echo "add new:80"  > /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers
  echo "remove hdd" > /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers

Alternatively, separate files for add, remove, and show could be used to
represent staged operations:

  echo "ssd:100,hdd:50,network_swap" >/sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers/add
  echo "new:80"  > /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers/add
  echo "hdd" > /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers/remove

When using the fullset approach:

  ssd:100(bit0), hdd:50(bit1), network_device(bit2)

If we remove the ssd layer and add a new tier:

  echo new:80,hdd:50,network_device >/sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers

The show output could display staged state (imaginary output for understanding):

  ssd:100(bit0), new:80(bit3, in stage), hdd:50(bit1, removing), network_device(bit2)

After the hdd tier reference drops to zero:

  ssd:100(bit0), new:80(bit3),  network_device(bit2)

I have already explained this from the perspective of option 2 mixed
with option 1. Let me clarify one point:

If...
ssd:100, hdd:50, network_device.
Insertion above 100 becomes visible after ssd removal,
Insertion above 50 becomes visible after hdd removal,
Insertion above 0 becomes visible after network_device removal.

It means that as long as the tier exists, the referenced priority ranges
cannot be overridden.

And Regarding swap_tier object lifecycle:

A swap_tier should not be deleted until all devices in the tier are
swapped off (As you said, references are held). Therefore, cgroups that reference a
tier should also hold a reference. Silently dropping a tier is problematic
from a cgroup perspective.

If we allow this, the implementation should behave as follows as I think:
If a swap_tier is removed, the cgroup’s tier configuration could be
marked invalid. This should trigger an event to the cgroup to notify
user space.

You suggested maintaining per-swap-device cluster caches. As an
alternative, I would like to suggest a per-device per-CPU cache
approach, which could be simpler from an integration perspective. It
would fit more naturally with the existing allocation logic, remove tier
awareness from the allocator, and should not introduce functional
differences in behavior. Moreover, since SSD devices are likely to be
concentrated in only a small number of tiers (with one being the "best"
tier), the number of clusters actually cached at any time would not be
large. I am not presenting this as the ultimate solution, but rather as
a simple and reasonably practical approach to consider. I agree that we
should revisit and evaluate this approach further.

Okay I will adopt default inheritance for pod-level and similar use cases. A
child cgroup inherits the nearest ancestor’s mask upon creation. If it
later sets its own mask, that configuration will apply to itself.

Many thanks for the detailed review. It helped clarify the implementation
direction, and I look forward to preparing the patch series accordingly.
