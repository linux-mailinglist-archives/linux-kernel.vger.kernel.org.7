So another fun finding. Sysfs and json events are case insensitive:
```
$ perf stat -e 'inst_retired.any,INST_RETIRED.ANY' true

Performance counter stats for 'true':

          129,134      cpu_atom/inst_retired.any:u/
    <not counted>      cpu_core/inst_retired.any:u/
                        (0.00%)
          129,134      cpu_atom/INST_RETIRED.ANY:u/
    <not counted>      cpu_core/INST_RETIRED.ANY:u/
                        (0.00%)

      0.002193191 seconds time elapsed

      0.002354000 seconds user
      0.000000000 seconds sys
```
But legacy events match in lex code that is case sensitive. This means
(on x86) the event 'instructions' is currently legacy, but the event
'INSTRUCTIONS' is a sysfs event. The event CYCLES is a parse error as
there is no sysfs/json version. Given legacy events don't follow the
case insensitivity norm this is more evidence we need to reduce their
priority by merging these patches.

Thanks,
Ian
