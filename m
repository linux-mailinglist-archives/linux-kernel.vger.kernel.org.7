Hmm, rb_end_commit() seems to try commit all nested events (committing > 1)
if committing == 1, and the rb_set_commit_to_write() pushes commit pointer
to the latest write pointer. So when it "start dropping events"? (is that
write side?)

Hmm, so this is the case that the writer is too fast and it moves
head page to the next page. Thus some events on old head page are
lost.

OK, so "wrapped the buffer" means "tail (write) page caught up the commit"?

OK.

Ah, I meant we should report it in printk buffer, since the event
lost will happen in some case and reader can notice that.

Thanks! Anyway, the logic looks good to me.
