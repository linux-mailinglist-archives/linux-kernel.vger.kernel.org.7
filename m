When it gets disabled, the system becomes non-functional.  What that
means is that everything stops, no more output, and even when I
enabled KDB it did not drop into KDB.  *Something* depends on it,
but there is no driver that properly enables the clock (yet).
This means--for now--it seems to be a critical clock.

This is what I believe is happening.  So my fix marks the one clock
as critical in the driver.  I would not want to mark it critical
in DT.

I provided the chain of clocks leading to the dma_clk.  Disabling
the dma_clk did not cause harm; disabling pmua_aclk did not cause
harm; disabling pll1_d8_307p2 did not cause harm.  Only when pll1_d8
was disabled did the machine become unusable.

No, I found that pll1_d8 had an enable count of 1 after dma_clk
was enabled.  And then the set of disables that resulted from the
-EPROBE_DEFER discovered its enable count was zero, and therefore
disabled pll1_d8 (after dma_clk, pmua_aclk, and pll1_d8_307p2 were
disabled).  I do not suspect the clock *driver* is at fault.

I did confirm this.  The child gets disabled before the parent in
clk_core_disable().

Maybe you could, as an experiment, pretend <&syscon_apmu CLK_DMA>
is a clock for something and get it during probe, using
devm_clk_get_optional_enabled().  Then just return -EPROBE_DEFER
after that, and I think you'll reproduce the issue.  In fact,
you might hit the issue more quickly if you used CLK_PLL1_D8.
