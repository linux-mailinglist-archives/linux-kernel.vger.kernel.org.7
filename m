Hi Robert,
Can you please share more on the background information and/or your specific concerns on the possible memory holes in the other platforms that need to be considered and not covered by Fabio's code? Let's all get on the same page of what specifics we need to consider to make this work. Preferably I want to avoid arch and platform specific code in CXL if possible. Of course that may not always be possible. Would like see if we can avoid a bunch of #ifdef X86/ARM/INTEL/AMD and do it more cleanly. But fully understand the situation first would be helpful to determine that. Thank you!

DJ
