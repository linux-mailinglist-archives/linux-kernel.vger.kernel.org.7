now. will disallow statically allocating a minor above 255 since below
disadvantages:

1) if the minor was requested by other dynamic request. requesting a
fixed minor which > 255 will be failed.

2) both fixed minors and dynamic minors interleave int the same space.

this patch is to solve such reentry issue.

I will split this RFC patch and modify test cases.

welcome to get your comments at any time. thank you (^^).
