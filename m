Right -- that was what I guessed, but thanks for confirming.

Agreed.  guard() is not a bad thing, but it's probably easier to use it
cleanly when writing new code.  Backporting it into existing code might
be worthwhile it it clearly makes the code simpler or fixes bugs, but
these cases in resctrl feel like they don't bring a lot of benefit.

Fair enough.  Considering how guard() _might_ be used can be a useful
exercise, even if the changes are not adopted everywhere.
