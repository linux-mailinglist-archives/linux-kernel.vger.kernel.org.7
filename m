On the contrary, it's called iommu_attach_group() :)

In fact this is precisely the usage model I would suggest for this sort 
of thing, and IIRC I had a similar conversation with the Ethos driver 
folks a few years back. Running your own IOMMU domain is no biggie, see 
several other DRM drivers (including rockchip). As long as you have a 
separate struct device per NPU core then indeed it should be perfectly 
straightforward to maintain distinct IOMMU domains per job, and 
attach/detach them as part of scheduling the jobs on and off the cores. 
Looks like rockchip-iommu supports cross-instance attach, so if 
necessary you should already be OK to have multiple cores working on the 
same job at once, without needing extra work at the IOMMU end.

Indeed if you're using the IOMMU API directly then you need to do your 
own address space management either way, so matching bits of process VA 
space is pretty simple to put on the table.
