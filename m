Forgot to mention, this Arc could contain vtables into the (driver) module after
the module has been removed already, which could be called into if reading
from / writing to a corresponding (leaked) debugfs file.

I really think Dir::keep() is an invitation for potentially horrible bugs.

If we really don't want SubDir, then let's not have keep() at all.
