We managed to get one for sc8280xp post release (was harder for x1e for
some reason).

That's odd. Doesn't happen here with the X1E CRD if I drop the uefi
offset property in DT. I'm back in the seventies but time is strictly
increasing also after reboots.

Perhaps you have some user space setting that resets it?

My point is that it's not really a solution. These machines still do not
have persistent UEFI variables, and now they have an apparently
functional but still broken RTC.

I added support for the UEFI offset to the driver so that the time could
be set on Qualcomm machines. With this series that is still not the
case, even if people may now initially get the impression that it works
since the time is only off by a few seconds (until it becomes minutes
and hours and you starting missing your trains).
