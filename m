Above code suggests that clocks are not needed for the mailbox at all.
You need to be really sure of that. If that's the case, then this
description looks like correct hardware description, more detailed then
the first case, though.

Clock is a provider - it has clock-cells - and it is post-init, because
mailbox (parent) does not need it to initialize itself. Only part of its
functionality - clocks - need it.

This probably could be fixed in the Linux?

Except missing dev_links you mentioned, this feels for me like job for
post-init-providers (option 1), but I am also fine with option 2,
because it fees like more appropriate hardware description.
