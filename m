You are correct. The userspace tool would be coming up with the
weights, so it would not be hard for it to write those weights to two
places. I coupled the weights used in DAMON and weighted interleaving
for this revision and the previous because I could not think of a use
case where you would want to use different weights for allocation time
and migration, so it felt silly to have two different places with the
same data. However, I don't feel too strongly about this, so I'm
willing to defer to your judgement.

Also, our userspace tool updates these weights somewhat frequently,
several times per minute, when it detects a change in the bandwidth
utilization of the system to calibrate the interleave ratio. I am
concerned about how frequent changes to the scheme via the sysfs
interface will affect the effectiveness of DAMON's page sampling. From
what I understand, updates to the sysfs aren't saved until the user
writes to some sysfs file to commit them, then the damon context is
recreated from scratch. Would this throw away all the previous
sampling work done and work splitting and merging regions? I am not
super familiar with how the sysfs interface interacts with the rest of
the system, so this concern might be entirely unfounded, but I would
appreciate some clarification here.

That sounds good to me! Having a prototype from you for the sysfs
interface would certainly be helpful, but if you're busy, I can take a
pass at it as well.
