I think here we both have different views of what is simpler... You are trying
to optimize for the callers writing less code. I'm trying to optimize for the
reader to be able to easily determine what the function will do for a given caller.

But it's your name above the door :) I don't want to bikeshed, so go ahead
change to HONOR.
