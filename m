One thing I wanted to emphasise - shouldn't we invoke
khugepaged_enter_vma() for VMAs we set VM_HUGEPAGE for?

I note in __mmap_new_vma() we do so for non-anon VMAs _prior_ to invoking
vma_set_thp_policy().

I _really_ hate putting in conditional logic like this for specific
cases. Feels very hacky.

To re-emphasise ^ the merging is key - I will unfortunately have to NACK
any series that breaks it. So this is an absolute requirement here.

Yes. This would be a worthwhile project in its own right.

I will be changing vma->vm_flags in the same way soon.

Yeah I thought it might be the case. I reemphasise my dislike of prctl().

Yeah, you can just do it earlier. But you maybe should just set the flag in
the appropriate field rather than using the set flags helper.

Ack.

I wrote the latest merge and mmap() code so am well placed on this :>)

But I don't think we should use vma_set_thp_policy() in these places, we
should just set the flag, to avoid trying to do a write lock etc. etc.,
plus we want to set the flag in a place that's not a VMA yet in both cases.

So we'd need something like in do_mmap():

+	vm_flags |= mm_implied_vma_flags(mm);
	addr = mmap_region(file, addr, len, vm_flags, pgoff, uf);

Where mm_implied_vma_flags() reads the MMF flags and sees if any imply VMA
flags.

But we have something for that already don't we? mm->def_flags.

Can't we use that actually? That should work for mmap too?
