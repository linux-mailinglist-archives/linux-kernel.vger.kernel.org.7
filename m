I've opened [0]. I don't have the permissions to add tags for that.

Yeah I understand that its not UB, but to me it seems a bit fragile and opaque why it is allowed.
That's what I meant by "a bit iffy".

Alright but I doubt that realistic, since the `Data` would always at
least be shared between the owner of `MiscDeviceRegistration` and the
`fops` implementation. Meaning its always shared with syscall context
and I don't think it makes sense to have a registration owed in 
that context.
