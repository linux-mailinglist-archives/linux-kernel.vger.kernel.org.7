Because 'aligned_index' already did round_down() before checking if it's 
suitable. So it's still considered an implicit alignment check.

"
	pages = 1UL << order;
	aligned_index = round_down(index, pages);
"

That's how I understand the code as well, I just wasn't very sure 
before. Thanks for your explanation which clarified my doubts.

I will drop the check in next version.
