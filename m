Per the architecture, SMMU interrupts are logically edge-triggered so 
there is nothing to clear at the SMMU end (the "interrupt status" is 
implicit in whatever condition caused an interrupt to be sent, e.g. the 
event queue becoming non-empty, SMMU_GERROR becoming different from 
SMMU_GERRORN, etc.)

If this is an Arm SMMU IP (MMU-600/700/S3) then the physical interrupt 
outputs are most definitely rising-edge. If somone's stuck some 
interrupt combiner in between those and the main interrupt controller, 
then yes, that interrupt combiner really should have its own driver.

If this thing is munging *all* the SMMU interrupt outputs as I suspect, 
then the big problem with that idea is that "the driver" is at least two 
separate drivers (SMMU and PMU), 3 if it has RAS and you ever want to 
entertain the idea of kernel-first handling.

Thanks,
Robin.
