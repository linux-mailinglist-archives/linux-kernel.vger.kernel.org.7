Please do, that is part of the community feedback and review process.

I have not questioned the approach you can achieve with your goal. The
real question is, is this the best approach to consider to merge into
the main line Linux kernel. Merging into the main line kernel has a
very high bar. How is it compared to other alternative approaches in
terms of technical merit and complexity trade offs.

Why would I trade a cleaner less complex approach for a more complex
approach with technical deficiency not able to address (inverting swap
entry LRU ordering)?

Let me clarify. LPC is not required to get your series merged. Giving
a talk in LPC usually is an honor. It does not guarantee your series
gets merged either. It certainly helps your idea get more exposure and
discussion. You might be able to meet some maintainers in person. For
me, it is nice to meet the person to whom I have been communicating by
email. I was making the suggestion because it can be a good topic for
LPC, and just in case you might enjoy LPC. It is totally for your
benefit. Up to your decision, please don't make it a burden. It is
not.

If after your consideration, you do want to submit a proposal in LPC,
you need to hurry though. The deadline is closing soon.

Let me make it very clear.  As it is, it will not get my support for
the reason I have laid out in my last email.

The per cgroup per swap file priorities has one Achilles heel you need
to address before you can make any further progress upstreaming it.
Putting the extra complexity aside, the per cgroup per swap file
priorities can invert swap entry LRU order between different views of
ordering by different cgroup.
That violates the swap entry LRU order between tiers.

From the swap file point of view, when it needs to flush some data to
the lower tiers, it is very hard if possible for swap file to maintain
per cgroup LRU order within a swap file.
It is much easier if all the swap entries in a swap file are in the
same LRU order tier.

Inverting swap entry LRU order is a deal breaker for your per cgroup
per swap file priority approach.

The swap.tiers idea is not a compromise, it is a straight win. Can you
describe what per cgroup per swap file can do while swap.tiers can
not?

Because I don't want to violate the swap entry LRU ordering between
tiers. Within that context, what usage case do you have in mind?
Within the same tier, the swap device can have finer grain priority
order between them. The part I haven't understood, please help me
understand, why do you need per cgroup per swap file orthering  rather
than the tier order? It is much easier from the admin's point of view.
This app needs to be fast, can't afford slow swap, give it faster swap
tiers.

It obviously will introduce new complexity. I want to understand the
reason to justify the additional complexity before I consider such an
approach.

My pleasure. Thanks for leading this per cgroup swap file effort.
