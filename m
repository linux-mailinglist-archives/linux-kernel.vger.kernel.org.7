Yes, I think the discussions on that series have shown that we might as
well refactor it completely. Once and for all™!

Agreed on both counts (replacing __HAVE_ARCH_ENTER_LAZY_MMU_MODE).

Looking at the arm64 implementation, I'm thinking: instead of the paused
member, how about a PF_LAZY_MMU task flag? It would be set when lazy_mmu
is actually enabled (i.e. inside an enter()/leave() section, and not
inside a pause()/resume() section). This way, architectures could use
that flag directly to tell if lazy_mmu is enabled instead of reinventing
the wheel, all in slightly different ways. Namely:

* arm64 uses a thread flag (TIF_LAZY_MMU) - this is trivially replaced
with PF_LAZY_MMU
* powerpc and sparc use batch->active where batch is a per-CPU variable;
I expect this can also be replaced with PF_LAZY_MMU
* x86/xen is more complex as it has xen_lazy_mode which tracks both
LAZY_MMU and LAZY_CPU modes. I'd probably leave that one alone, unless a
Xen expert is motivated to refactor it.

With that approach, the implementation of arch_enter() and arch_leave()
becomes very simple (no tracking of lazy_mmu status) on arm64, powerpc
and sparc.

(Of course we could also have an "enabled" member in lazy_mmu_state
instead of PF_LAZY_MMU, there is no functional difference.)

Indeed, this is how I thought about it. There is actually quite a lot
that can be moved to the generic functions:
* Updating lazy_mmu_state
* Sanity checks on lazy_mmu_state (e.g. underflow/overflow)
* Bailing out if in_interrupt() (not done consistently across arch's at
the moment)

We might want to rename them to align with the new generic helpers, but
yes otherwise the principle should remain unchanged.

In fact, we will also need to revive arch_flush_lazy_mmu_mode(). Indeed,
in the nested situation, we need the following arch calls:

enter() -> arch_enter()
    enter() -> [nothing]
    leave() -> arch_flush()
leave() -> arch_leave()

leave() must always flush whatever arch state was batched, as may be
expected by the caller.

How does all that sound?

I'm not sure we'd want to mix those styles (task_struct member + local
variable), that's adding complexity without much upside... Also having a
local variable at every nesting level only makes sense if we have an
arch callback regardless of nesting level, which is unnecessary in this
proposed API.

I suppose this could improve the overall struct layout - but otherwise I
don't really see the need compared to adding members to thread_struct
(which is fully arch-specific).
