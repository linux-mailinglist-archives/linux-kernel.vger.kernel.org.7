I agree, avoiding the dynamic dispatch is probably not worth in this case
considering the long term. However, I wanted to point out an alternative with
[2].

Honestly, I don't know how dynamic dispatch scales compared to static dispatch
with conditionals.

OOC, I briefly looked for a benchmark and found [3], which doesn't look
unreasonable at a first glance.

I modified it real quick to have more than 2 actions. [4]

2 Actions
---------
Dynamic Dispatch: time:   [2.0679 ns 2.0825 ns 2.0945 ns]
 Static Dispatch: time:   [850.29 ps 851.05 ps 852.36 ps]

20 Actions
----------
Dynamic Dispatch: time:   [21.368 ns 21.827 ns 22.284 ns]
 Static Dispatch: time:   [1.3623 ns 1.3703 ns 1.3793 ns]

100 Actions
-----------
Dynamic Dispatch: time:   [103.72 ns 104.33 ns 105.13 ns]
 Static Dispatch: time:   [4.5905 ns 4.6311 ns 4.6775 ns]

Absolutely take it with a grain of salt, I neither spend a lot of brain power
nor time on this, which usually is not a great combination with benchmarking
things. :)

However, I think it's probably not too important here. Hence, feel free to go
with dynamic dispatch for this.

That's not a huge concern for me, it's only one single allocation per Engine,
correct?
