Because I looked at the logical changes that went into the big squash
that was initially planned, and requested that some of those was kept
intact - because they where independent logical changes.

We used to add things node by node and that was indeed not
comprehensible. Overall this adds features in large logical chunks, but
there are a few of the patches that could have been squashed.

I can see your argument for one patch to introduce the soc. But two
doesn't make sense, because that incremental patch is going to be the
kitchen sink.

Definitely agree that we don't want one patch for every tiny block!

The big picture is already obscured due to the size of the content
added.

Comparing to previous targets, I see the baseline content in 2-3
patches, and the remainder of the series being things that usually has
been scattered in many more small changes in the following weeks or
months.

There's plenty of features in this series that are yet to be concluded
for SM8750.

I agree with this. That's why the QRD is 1 patch, and MTP is 4 (this I
think should be squashed to 2) - compared to 13 patches for across the
pair for SM8750 with less scope.

I'm not sure what you're disappointed in, this initial series is larger
than any we've seen before. I really like the work Jingyi has done here,
aggregating the otherwise scattered patches into one series.
