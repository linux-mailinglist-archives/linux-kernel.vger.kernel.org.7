To be clear, I hit this with just normal probe deferral (not explicit
async probe).

Perhaps add a reference to my report:

This looks like it should work and nothing blows up even if I haven't
tried to instrument a reliable reproducer to test it against:

That said, don't you have a similar issue with:

What prevents a racing client driver probe from having set dev->driver
