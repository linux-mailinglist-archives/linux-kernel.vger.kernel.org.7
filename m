One of the points in Christian's suggestion was that ioctl doesn't have to
be bound to a misc device. Even if we don't use read()/write()/link() etc,
we can have a filesystem that exposes, say, "control" file and that file
has the same liveupdate_ioctl() in its fops as we have now in miscdev.

The cost is indeed a bit of boilerplate code to create the filesystem, but
it would be easier to extend for per-service and containers support.

And we won't need sysfs entry for status, as it can be also pre-populated
in kexecfs (or whatever it'll be called).
