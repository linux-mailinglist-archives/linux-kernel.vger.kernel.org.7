Subject: [PATCH v13 3/4] drm/atomic-helper: Re-order bridge chain pre-enable and post-disable

From: Aradhya Bhatia <a-bhatia1@ti.com>

Move the bridge pre_enable call before crtc enable, and the bridge
post_disable call after the crtc disable.

The sequence of enable after this patch will look like:

	bridge[n]_pre_enable
	...
	bridge[1]_pre_enable

	crtc_enable
	encoder_enable

	bridge[1]_enable
	...
	bridge[n]_enable

And, the disable sequence for the display pipeline will look like:

	bridge[n]_disable
	...
	bridge[1]_disable

	encoder_disable
	crtc_disable

	bridge[1]_post_disable
	...
	bridge[n]_post_disable

The definition of bridge pre_enable hook says that,
"The display pipe (i.e. clocks and timing signals) feeding this bridge
will not yet be running when this callback is called".

Since CRTC is also a source feeding the bridge, it should not be enabled
before the bridges in the pipeline are pre_enabled. Fix that by
re-ordering the sequence of bridge pre_enable and bridge post_disable.

While at it, update the drm bridge API documentation as well.
