I think we'd have to check with Vladimir on that. He said that he didn't 
change some devices that use DMA to use XSPI because he couldn't verify 
that they would still work [1]. So by adding this fallback we would be 
making that decision now, which I'm not sure we can do. It would 
probably be better to add the stubs that make the probe fail rather than 
register a driver with a fallback that we don't know works.

That was my thinking.

I can add it, I'm just questioning the usefulness of adding a new 
config option that's unlikely to be used in reality. It only achieves 
the same thing as doing #if CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE in one place in the code.

Ultimately we're just trying to fix some randconfig error, if we start 
adding new knobs for people to turn just do that, there's a risk they 
won't get used and we'll make configuring more complicated for people.

Testing might be a partial justification, but that config wouldn't allow 
you to force DMA mode where XSPI is used. You would almost certainly be 
doing that too if you are doing that kind of testing, and you'd have to 
hack the driver anyway to do that.
