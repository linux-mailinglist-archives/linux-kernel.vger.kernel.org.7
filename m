Which parent device? That is my point, if the top level node for the
whole CTRL_MMR region is made into one big syscon, then a big regmap
is made that covers the whole region. All the child devices also make
regmaps covering their device range. Now these registers under the child
device belong to two different regmaps. No synchronization is done as
these are not the same regmap, regmap only handles this for multiple
access to registers within the same regmap.

Let's take a real example, here is part of AM62A CTRL_MMR node.

main_conf: bus@100000 {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <0x00 0x00 0x00100000 0x20000>;

	phy_gmii_sel: phy@4044 {
		compatible = "ti,am654-phy-gmii-sel";
		reg = <0x4044 0x8>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
	};

	...
};

If we turn "main_conf" into a syscon, then who "owns" 0x4044?
Both the top level syscon and phy_gmii_sel nodes would build
a different regmap instance that contains those same registers.

Bit of back story, this is actually how I got involved in sorting
out this "syscon" stuff for our devices. I built a checker into
the regmap framework core that would detect when multiple regmaps
are created that contain overlapping registers.

I found several bugs this way and want to push the check upstream at
some point. But first I wanted to fix the biggest cause of warnings,
which was from syscon being used as described above.

If this ddr-pmctrl device is not modeled as a syscon device, then who
says it has to be more than a few (3?) registers in size? This seems like
a rather arbitrary rule, and completely unfeasible for several whole
classes of devices that only have/need a few registers to work them.
