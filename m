My confusion got cleared by what Daniel wrote:

I'll try to explain what my initial question regardless, maybe that'll
clear up your confusion :)

My initial question was whether `regulator_disable` would drop the
refcount (in the case of success and/or in the case of failure). Since
if it failed in the quoted code:

> +    /// Disables the regulator.
> +    pub fn disable(self) -> Result<Regulator> {
> +        // Keep the count on `regulator_get()`.

> +        // SAFETY: Safe as per the type invariants of `Self`.
> +        let res =3D to_result(unsafe { bindings::regulator_disable(regul=
ator.as_ptr()) });
So this call would fail                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

> +
> +        res.map(|()| Regulator {
> +            inner: regulator.inner.inner,
> +        })
> +    }

Then the `.map` call below the `regulator_disable` call would not take
ownership of the `inner.inner` value of the `regulator` variable, since
the `res` variable would be the `Err` variant of the `Result` enum (the
closure supplied to the `map` function only operates on the `Ok`
variant). This would mean that the refcount is not decremented, but the
`Regulator` wouldn't be available to the caller any more, thus leaking
the refcount.

Now if the `regulator_disable` function took ownership of the refcount
(ie decrement it, or store the regulator somewhere else that would own
that refcount), then this would be fine.

See my reply to Daniel as for what I suggest to do about the refcount
leak.
