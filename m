So effectively turn mprotect_folio_pte_batch() into an iterator; have a struct
and a funtion to init the struct for the the number of ptes we want to iterate
over, then a per iteration function that progressively returns batches?

Then we just have a simple loop here that gets the next batch and processes it?
