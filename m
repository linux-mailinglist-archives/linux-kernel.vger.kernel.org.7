The emulation you are doing makes sense.

Just a few more points.  I am not current but I have never seen
concurrency (inside of a packet) at the network layer.

I don't recall ever hearing the write paths in the network stack
were ever a problem.

I suspect the write side you can verify fairly easily by simply
compiling in appletalk and opening a PF_APPLETALK socket, and sending a
message.  If that doesn't trigger emulation I can't image any other
write path in the kernel will.
