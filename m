Ok, let's knock up the api here first before worrying about the
implementation, as we seem to all be a bit confused as to what we want
to do.

Ideally, yes, I would like to NOT have any rust structure represent a
debugfs file, as that is the way the C api has been evolving.  We are
one step away from debugfs_create_file() being a void function that
doesn't return anything, and I don't want to see us go "backwards" here.

But the main reason I did that work was to keep people from trying to
determine if a file creation worked or not and to do different logic
based on that.  I think the Rust api CAN do both here, as you and Alice
have explained, so we should be ok.

So how about this for an example api, two structures, debugfs::Directory
and debugfs::File, which have only two types of operations that can be
done on them:

To create a debugfs directory, we do:

	let my_dir = debugfs::Directory::new("foo_dir", parent);

There is no other Directory method, other than "drop", when the object
goes out of scope, which will clean up the directory and ALL child
objects at the same time (implementation details to be figured out
later.)

That will ALWAYS succeed no matter if the backend debugfs call failed or
not, and you have no way of knowing if it really did create something or
not.  That directory you can then use to pass into debugfs file or
directory creation functions.

Same for creating a debugfs file, you would do something like:

	let my_file = debugfs::File::new("foo_file", my_dir);

depending on the "file type" you want to create, there will be different
new_* methods (new_u32, new_u64, etc.).

which also ALWAYS succeeds.  And again, as you want to keep objects
around, you have to have a reference on it at all times for it to exist
in the filesystem.  If you drop it, then it too will be removed from
debugfs.

And again, that's the only operation you can do on this object, there
are no other methods for it other than "new" and "drop".

Now there are issues with implementation details here like:
  - Do you want to keep the list of file and dir objects in the rust
    structure to manually clean them up when we go to drop the
    directory?
  - Do we want to force all files to be dropped before the directory?
    Or do we want to just let the C side clean it all up automagically
    instead?
and other things like that, but we can argue about that once we settle
on the outward-facing api first.

I can live with this type of api.  It's simple and seems hard to abuse
or get wrong from a user point-of-view, and should be pretty
straight-forward on the binding side as well.  It will take a bit more
work on the user when creating debugfs files than the C api did, but
that's something that you want to impose on this api, not me :)

Sound reasonable?  Or am I missing something else here?

thanks,
