That is not what this is doing. In fact, the very first paragraph
of the documentation page that was too long for you to read does
explain this. What are you trying to achieve with this response?

That is what this is.

No you don't, that does not explain the operations on them. The way
the kernel embeds nodes as struct members to then do a container_of
on is not obvious to many, as is evidenced by there existing out-of-
tree documentation explaining this very fact. The way this interacts
with how these list operations are called is worth documenting.

> Then a list of the valid operations for that list type.

Function names are not self-explanatory. That lists are circular and
how that can break traversal after list modifications is not immediately
evident.

No. O-notation was invented for a reason. There is no way in which you
can construct a list to make it not a linear search, even if you sort
it.

hlist literally just lacks a single pointer in the head, it does not
differ from the kernel's doubly linked list in any meaningful way,
and would be an actual TL;DR.

I don't see how your opinion on the datastructure is relevant here.
