Hi Nico,

As suggested, I did some new runs of my workloads with your
recommended configurations (on akpm/mm-new this time). The results for
the subset that my team is most interested in still do not show
significant improvements (in the context of the delta between the
control test and the thp=3Dalways case).

On the bright side, I did observe that the Rodinia OpenMP tests show
slightly more noticeable performance improvements when defer+collapse
are in use than without, and I also did not observe any concerning
regression indicators in any of these results.

My report for these tests is attached if you'd like to take a look. [0] Tha=
nks!
