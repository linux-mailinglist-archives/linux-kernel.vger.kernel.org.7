You do need to create the stubs.  But you also have the option of
simplifying the code, for example, by removing structure fields that
you are not using and providing static instances of the needed structures.

That is what I do.  ;-)

Agreed.  But in this case, we only need to know whether or not they
were called, so a very simple stub suffices.

You can also speed things up by replacing the Kconfig options with
variables, thus allowing full exploration in one run.  And dispensing
with the dazzling implementation of IS_ENABLED().  ;-)
