I've already started to work on the v6, so it doesn't matter. I'll also
cover some new decisions made during improving v6 in the reply.

I'll prefer to keep the regmap lock in the toplevel structure for now.
Moving the pointer into the union requires special care: we cannot
simply assign lock_regmap with NULL anymore in spacemit_ccu_register()
without checking the subtype of clk_hw, or part of the mix/ddn's struct
may be overwritten.

Keeping lock_regmap out of the union ensures the code is simple and
makes it less possible to accidentally mess the union up.

I changed my mind and consider it's better to keep these macros in
ccu_pll.c, since it isn't that useful outside of the file (knowing the
exact definition of swcr3 doesn't help much, as we're really defining
some magic values). It's not a strong opinion anyway.

Thanks, this should help :)

I guess I've roughly located the cause, the warning is probably
triggered by PLL3,

- Comparing with vendor U-Boot, the driver is missing three or four
  entries and one of them matches the SWCR1 value (0x0050cd61)
- There's a typo when defining PLL3,

+static CCU_PLL_DEFINE(pll3, pll3_rate_tbl,
+                     APBS_PLL3_SWCR1, APBS_PLL2_SWCR3,

  here APBS_PLL2_SWCR3 should be APBS_PLL3_SWCR3. This explains the
  value of SWCR3 (0x3fe00000) in your case, where it's actually read
  from PLL2's register.

I'll add the missing configuration entries and fix the typo in v6.

I didn't expect calls to ccu_pll_enable() may happen when the
previous stage bootloaders have already initialized the PLL. So the
right anwswer is yes, clk_ops->enable() may be called when the
underlying clock hardware has been enabled, but remove the check
shouldn't hurt, either: it's okay to rewrite the register as long as
we don't change rate-related settings if the PLL is enabled.
