Exactly they represent different context of execution. Trap represents a
non-linear control flow change and thus a fresh start of execution control
flow into kernel while `kernel-induced` one's are again non-linear but
fully a kernel/software construct.

A fresh trapped execution context shouldn't have SUM set which is how it is
currently in kernel. This bit gets cleared in trap entry and `sstatus` gets
saved in `pt_regs` (including SR_IE) so that it could be restored whenever
`sret` happens.

The problem we'are seeing here is two fold--

1) We don't want to set and clear when we are accessing array/string for each
    word. This is software problem and this entire series is addressing it.

2) To avoid first problem we are optimizing the access to CSR by setting it
    once and clearing it once. But now we don't want to loose this bit if there
    were:

	a) trap in between 
         b) kernel induced schedule out
         c) a) followed by b)
         d) a) followed by another a)
         e) nested traps

If a) occurs, we are definitley loosing the bit as per current code. If b)
happens then also the same situation.

Saving it in `thread_struct` only addresses `b`. And not `a`, `c`, `d` and
`e`. IMHO `e` is far-fetched situation but I believe `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` happen
during normal runtime of kernel.

So it all depends on nesting level of traps supported by riscv kernel.

Illustraing `c + d` example, if kernel can take 2 nested level of traps with
first trap context having had the SUM bit set, but the second trap had it clear
and now comes the switch out of this thread, at this point if it were saved in
`thread_struct` SUM would be lost for the first trap.

Later when the thread gets switched in again, you would go in 2nd trap
context without SUM (because `thread_context` didnt had it saved), which is
fine. Although when 2nd trap context eventually performs `sret`, it will
go back to first trap context where SUM was expected to be set because it
touching a user memory.

A good example would be a syscall, so that's the first trap. SUM bit is set,
touched user memory and took a trap (page fault). Now code is in second trap
which should clear the SUM bit. Somewhere in memory manager stack, thread is
scheduled out and now `sstatus` is saved in `thread_struct`. This is only
serving current trap context needs and not the one where `SUM` needed to be
set.

We can support such nesting only by ensuring below

On trap entry do 
- save `status` in `pt_regs` or some other FILO data structure
- clear SUM (and other bits needed to be cleared)

On trap return do
- reload `status` from `pt_regs` or some FILO data structure

Quite analogous to what we do for SR_IE as well.
