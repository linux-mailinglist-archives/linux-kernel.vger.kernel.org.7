Sure. I will add something along those lines.

Yeah. That's possible. The current series is just trying to trap & 
enable rather
than trap & emulate except for few AIA related bits which trap even with 
hstateen
bit set due to sw file instead of vsfile.

Once we have such requirement any other feature bit, we can extend the 
generic
trap & enable framework to trap & emulate.
