We can always add it back if we really need it, but adding an allowlist
*and* a mechanism to override the allowlist at the same time seems overly
pessimistic to me :)

Cheers. v6.15-rc1 is probably the right base to use as that's what I've
based for-next/mm on.

Damn, yes, you're right. However, it still feels horribly hacky to iterate
over the online CPUs in has_bbml2_noabort() -- the cpufeature framework
has the ability to query features locally and we should be able to use
that. We're going to want that should the architecture eventually decide
on something like BBML3 for this.

What we have with BBML2_NOABORT seems similar to an hwcap in that we only
support the capability if all CPUs have it (rejecting late CPUs without it
in that case) but we can live without it if not all of the early CPUs
have it. Unlikely hwcaps, though, we shouldn't be advertising this to
userspace and we can't derive the capability solely from the sanitised
system registers.

I wonder if we could treat it like an erratum in some way instead? That
is, invert things so that CPUs which _don't_ have BBML2_NOABORT are
considered to have a "BBM_CONFLICT_ABORT" erratum (which we obviously
wouldn't shout about). Then we should be able to say:

  - If any of the early CPUs don't have BBML2_NOABORT, then the erratum
    would be enabled and we wouln't elide BBM.

  - If a late CPU doesn't have BBML2_NOABORT then it can't come online
    if the erratum isn't already enabled.

Does that work? If not, then perhaps the cpufeature/cpuerrata code needs
some surgery for this.

That's probably wishful thinking, sadly :(
