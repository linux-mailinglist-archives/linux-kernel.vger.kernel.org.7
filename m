I understand your point that you are trying to make the hypervisor
transparent, but it is not behaving in this way. One example is that we still
enforce a limit on the size of the ffa_descr_buffer for reclaiming memory.
Letting this aside, I am curios (maybe on another thread) what do we
gain by trying to keep the same behaviour w/o pkvm ?

I think blindly-forwarding the release call is problematic and we should
prevent this from happening. It is wrong from multipple pov: the host is not
the owner of the hyp_rx buffer and you are asking TZ to release the
hypervisor RX buffer by forwarding it. Do you agree on that ? I think
like this patch should include this.

If we apply what I suggested earlier we won't have an issue with the
semantic for this call but it would make the code a mess. I don't think
for this particular call keeping semantics really makes a difference.

This was most likely observed from an issue from the EL1 driver (by not
calling release explicitly), it was reported by Andrei Homescu
<ahomescu@google.com>. it appears that we also have to do something
in the hyp about it and we agreed with Will and Sudeep in the previous version of
the patch:
