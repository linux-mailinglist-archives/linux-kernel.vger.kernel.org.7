OK, I understood. In short, you create problems by hacking up or misusing
your trace handlers in ways it shouldn't be, and now you are t/crying to
solve those problems.

I can understand that part, but my hacking up things the way you have
shown above, though you may think you have achieved some feature very
smartly, you have just dug up the hole with issues you are facing now.

The only reason IIUC s2idle info is used is to identify when the RPM
is disabled. You are using that info to manage GIC power state.

The CPU deepest idle states entered in the normal and s2idle must be
same. If you want to still achieve extra power save with GIC powerdown
make it completely transparent to the OS.
