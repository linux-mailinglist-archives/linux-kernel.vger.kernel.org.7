You're right. The manual says

  "Implementations that support Sv48 must also support Sv39."

  ...

  "Implementations that support Sv57 must also support Sv48."

I was quite sure this was no the case, my memory failed me. Thanks for
pointing it out :)

Right, we could directly go into SV39 (perhaps that would be easier 
to read). However, the exact same thing will happen as it is, we'll 
just waste some extra cycles.

Makes sense. Using the mmu-type from the device tree + "no5lvl" "no4lvl"
boot arguments the user can boot into their desired mode.

Should we leave the current code as a fallback if the device tree 
doesn't contain such information? I'm not sure if it is mandatory
or if assuming it is might break some platform.

I will try changing the flow and exiting early into SV39 once a non 
canonical address is encountered in case we need to keep the 
probing part.

Thanks!
