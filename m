I guess you are saying about sysfs files?  Yes, I think listing those all is
unnecessary.

Assuming "knobs" mean sysfs files, this is incorrect.  Writing "commit" to
"state" passes the parameters written on appropriate files to running kdamond.
It doesn't update any sysfs files until a "update_*" keyword is written to the
"state" file.

Thank you for this nice question.  Yes.  Enabling "refresh_ms" is roughly same
to periodically writing
"update_{tuned_intervals,schemes_stats,schemes_effective_quotas" to "state"
file.
