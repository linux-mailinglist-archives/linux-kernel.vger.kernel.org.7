But, that defines what happens "on the wire", right?

The MHI specification doesn't state that you have to expose this to the
user in the form of taking a "size" and a "num_tre" number and then
expose a "start" knob which performs a loopback test, of which result
you can then find in a "status" file?

You're already changing the user-facing interface, because downstream
this is implemented using UCI...and I bet it's not sysfs files in
Windows...

I'm not talking about extensions to the protocol, or how the endpoint is
supposed to react.

I'm saying that it should be perfectly fine to have a test that just
fills the out-pipe with packets containing say the current timestamp,
and when they return I compare the timestamp in the payload with the
clock to see how long time the particular message took to loop back.
Same LOOPBACK protocol, different user-interface.

I think you should include a comment in the driver as well, stating that
the user-facing interface is ABI and the MHI LOOPBACK protocol defines
that the payload has to be random etc. If that is the case...

Fair enough.

I expect even you will use this interface approximately 0% of the times
you boot the kernel. _Users_ will never use it.

So, I guess per your suggestion, we leave this disabled everywhere
(defconfig, distros etc), and then those few _developers_ who want it
can enable it?
