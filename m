That's the thing though: i915 deviates pretty heavily from the helpers,
in general. If it wants to consume them, then it must also be ready to
make some adjustments. Or just roll its own thing like it has done in
the past.

Otherwise, where do we draw the line when anyone isn't happy with the
helpers in general and ask for an exception because reworking the driver
is too much work?

We did this on pretty much every ARM platform, we did this for amdgpu,
but somehow i915 should get a pass?

On what ground? What should we tell the next driver that uses the same
argument?

I'm not sure how pointing fingers at who has the right design,
overlooked some hypothetical usages 10y down the line, or is being
offhand helps the conversation in any way.

I've been asking questions to understand what you could work with, and
some are still left unanswered, and had to ask others multiple times to
get an answer.

And maybe I do indeed underestimate the amount of work it would take. I
don't believe so, and I still believe that it wouldn't be too hard. But
maybe you're right. You still haven't explained why it would take
anything more than registering a dumb device at probe time though.

I believe calling drm_panel_init would be a middle ground, if we add a
bunch of warnings, checks here and there and move things around a bit.
But to keep it, we do need a good reason for it, even more so if we
don't have any in-tree users anymore.
