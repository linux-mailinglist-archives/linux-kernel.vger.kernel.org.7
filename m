Ah okay, I wasn't even aware that this possible too. However this is DT

IIRC I added the following patch to solve this:

 - [PATCH 1/3] serdev: ttyport: make use of tty_kopen_exclusive

Sorry for not remembering the details since this conversation/patchset
is quite old but still one of our top prios.

As said, patch-1 should address this issue.
