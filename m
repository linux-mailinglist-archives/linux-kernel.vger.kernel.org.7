NS is nice, but perhaps it's not the approach for some cases.

For offloading/accelerator scenarios, ACPU is responsible for making all
the important decisions, including creations of endpoints. Because all
the user-awared software stack is running on ACPU, and if you want to
create a endpoint _dynamically_, it must be from user's command which is
from ACPU.

And this series is more about how rpmsg_char and rpmsg_ctrl coordinate
themselves about creating dynamic rpmsg endpoints in a more simple
and efficient way.

And the whole point of series is "When you want to return a fd to
userspace which represents an instance of data structure in kernel, you
don't implement it as character device". Maybe some quotes from Christian[1]
can describe it better[1]:

"I'm not sure why people are so in love with character device based apis.
It's terrible. It glues everything to devtmpfs which isn't namespacable
in any way. It's terrible to delegate and extremely restrictive in terms
of extensiblity if you need additional device entries (aka the loop
driver folly)."
