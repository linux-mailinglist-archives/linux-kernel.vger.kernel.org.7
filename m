True.  But we don't need to care about lightly loaded systems as they
won't cause problems.

Right, but I'm afraid practically it'll increase the chance of lost
in system-wide mode.  The default size of the sample for system-wide
is 56 byte and the size of the switch is 48 byte.  And the default
sample frequency is 4000 Hz but it cannot control the rate of the
switch.  I saw around 10000 Hz of switches per CPU on my work env.

This can be an option and it'd work well on lightly loaded systems.
Maybe we can just try it first.  But I think it's better to have an
option to make it work on heavily loaded systems.

I'm not sure how we can add the fake samples.  The switch events will be
from the kernel and we may add the condition in the attribute.

And PERF_SAMPLE_CPU is on by default in system-wide mode.

I don't know how severe the situation will be.  On heavily loaded
systems, the idle task won't run much and data size won't increase.
On lightly loaded systems, increased data will likely be handled well.

I'm not sure how it can help.  We don't need the switch info itself.
What's needed is when the CPU was idle, right?
