However, building a #UD instruction emulator is a project in itself that s=
omeone would have to take on=2E It isn't inherently simpler =E2=80=93 quite=
 the opposite =E2=80=93 than the alternatives calling to a stub function th=
an we have now=2E

We have the tools to do it; there is now a full x86 instruction decoder in=
 the kernel that one could use to do this, but=2E=2E=2E

a=2E Someone would have to take it on;
b=2E It will need continuous testing;
c=2E That someone would *also* have to go through the additional effort of=
 keeping the mainline code clean for the maintainers of the modern hardware=
=2E

And at some point we will be at a point where we were with i386 that the o=
nly users are occasional testers=2E

With regards to EISA, you still haven't clarified if there is a true use c=
ase or if this is a museum/nostalgia project=2E There isn't anything *wrong=
* with museum projects, not at all (I recently got to play SPACEWAR! on a r=
eal PDP-1; it was amazing) but imposing a maintenance burden on the mainlin=
e developers of one of the most heavily used architecture on the planet is =
not practical=2E

If someone really wanted to, they could maybe fork off, say, arch/i486 and=
 maintain the a version of the kernel limited to these old machines, but it=
 would require someone being willing to do the work=2E=20
