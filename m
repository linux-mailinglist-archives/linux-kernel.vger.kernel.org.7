Not a problem at all. I have been pretty busy this week and don't have

Yes, I slept on it for a few days. I reached a similar conclusion.
I am happy to share my thoughts:
1) FACT: We don't have any support to move data from swap device to
another swap device nowadays. It will not happen overnight. Talking
about those percentage allocation and maintaining those percentages is
super complicated. I question myself getting ahead of myself on this
feature.
2) FACT: I don't know if any real customers want this kind of
sub-cgroup swap per tier max adjustment. We should write imaginary
code for imaginary customers and reserve the real coding for the real
world customers. Most of the customers I know, including our company,
care most about the top level CGroup swap assignment. There are cases
that enable/disable per sub CGroup swap device, in the QoS sense not
the swap max usage sense.
I think this will be one good question to ask feedback in the LPC MC
discussion. Does anyone care about per tier max adjustment in the
cgroup? We should only consider that when we have real customers.

So I would shelf this per tier max adjustment and not spend any more time o=
n it.

I am glad you like it.

We are in agreement here. We should not touch it until we have a real
customer ask for it.

I suggest "/sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers" just to make the file name look
different from the "swap.tiers" in the cgroup interface.
This former defines all tiers, giving tiers a name and range. The
latter enroll a subset of the tiers.
 I think the tier bit location does not have to follow the priority
order. If we allow adding a new tier, the new tier will get the next
higher bit. But the priority it split can insert into the middle thus
splitting an existing tier range. We do need to expose the tier bits
into the user space. Because for madvise()  to set tiers for VMA, it
will use bitmasks. It needs to know the name of the bitmask mapping,
I was thinking the mm/swap/tiers read back as one tier a line. show:
name, bitmask bit, range low, range high

If the fast path fails, it will go through the slow path. So the slow
patch is actually a catch all.
> 3. Cgroup interface format modeled after cpuset.
I am not very familiar with the cpuset part of the interface. Maybe
you should explain that to the reader without using cpuset cgroup as a
reference.
> 4. No inheritance between parent and child cgroup as a perspective of QoS
In my original proposal of "swap.tiers", if the default is not set on
this tier, it will look up the parent until the root memcg. There are
two different tiers bitmask.
One is the local tier bitmask. The other is the effective bitmask.
If local tier bitmask sets the default, the effective tier bitmask =3D=3D
local tier bitmask
if local tier bitmask does not set default, The effective tier is
concatenation from parent to this memcg.

For example
a/swap.tiers: - +ssd # ssd only
a/b/swap.tiers: ""  # effective "- +ssh", also ssd only.
a/b/c : + -hdd # effective "- +ssd + -hdd", simplify as "+ -hdd"  The
'+' overwrite the default, anything before that can be ignored.

That way, if you are not setting anything in "swap.tiers" in the child
cgroup, that is the default behavior when you create a new cgroup.
Changing the parent can change all the child cgroup at the same time.

> 5. Runtime modification of tier settings allowed.
Need to clarify which tier setting? "swap.tiers" or /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tie=
rs?

I want to verify and remove the NUMA autobind from swap later. That
will make things simpler for swap. I think the reason the NUMA swap
was introduced does not exist any more.

Just don't do that. Ignore until there is a real usage case request.

Madvise(). That can be introduced earlier. I know a usage case for
that is the android. Android does not set every app as a cgroup. I
haven't checked for a while if that is still true.

No for now. Need to answer how to deal with swap entry LRU order
inversion issue.
