And we did do some of the cleverness that Petr points out because of
problems caused by flooding the console log.  We first ran into this
sort of thing on embedded systems with slow serial consoles (where 115K
baud is now way slow), but it also shows up in other environments, for
example, those committing large numbers of console logs to stable storage,
multiplexing large numbers of logs across networks that sometimes get
congested, and so on.

So I second the call for individual knobs, either in addition to or
instead of the global knob.

It definitely can cause problems, and me learning this the hard way is
why rcutorture calls tracing_off() before calling ftrace_dump().

No argument here.
