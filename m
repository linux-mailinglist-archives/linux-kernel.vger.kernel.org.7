Thank you for digging into this!!!

I can do that.  Patch below.

Yes, that bug fix is reflected in the lockless-fastpath patch.  It no
longer treats ->begin==0 as special.  The reason that this is 32-bit
specific is that at 1000HZ, a 32-bit counter wraps every 50 days or so,
which is well within the range of possible uptimes.  Wrapping for 64-bit
counter takes way longer.

In theory, something sort of like this that used a 16-byte cmpxchg
and packed the ->begin, ->rs_n_left, and ->flags fields together could
simplify this quite a bit.  But not every system has a 16-byte cmpxchg
on the on hand and packing into 8 bytes (let alone a 32-bit system's 4
bytes) would require painful tradeoffs.  But in practice...

...as you say, the full-load throughput of cmpxchg() is lacking compared
to that of atomic_dec_return().  And large systems might have serious
___ratelimit() call rates.  Worse yet, the forward-progress properties
of cmpxchg() are lacking compared to those of atomic_dec_return(), so I
am not at all sold on this packing approach, even for systems providing
16-byte cmpxchg operations.

Yes, if a given ratelimit_state structure is mostly throttling, the
load-only fastpath is there, but the quadratic overload behavior of
cmpxchg() would apply during the non-throttling phases.

Never say never, of course, but we would need to see real issues
with the atomic_dec_return() approach before it would make sense
to take on the packing approach.
