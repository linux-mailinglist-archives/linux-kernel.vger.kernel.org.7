*groan*, so booting with noefi (I just went and found that option) will
cause a modern Linux system to fail booting?

What the actual fuck!! And we support this garbage? Without
pr_err(FW_BUG ) notification?

How can one find such devices? I need to check my machine.

At the very least I think we should start printing scary messages about
disabling security to run untrusted code. This is all quite insane :/
