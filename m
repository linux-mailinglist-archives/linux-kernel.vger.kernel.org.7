Thank you for sharing the detailed context, I will add this history with the
link to the last paragraph of this section, or the 'Related Works' section.

Sounds good, I will do so in the next version.

Sure, I think the 'unlock' label would be appropriate part to add the unmap
code.  I also got your correction of s/kunmap/kunmap_local() in the reply.  I
will not miss that on the next version.

Yes.

I agree it could look weird.  I prefer keeping the code in a way more familiar
to ones who will keep maintain the file.  So I will modify this as below, in
the next version.

    comp_ret ? comp_ret : -EINVAL

I'm not very clearly getting your point.

I was thinking we should increase the counter if we "reject" the page (does not
save the content in the zpool) due to failing at compressing the page's content
into a size smaller than PAGE_SIZE.  This patch implements the behavior.

Am I missing a mis-implementation of the behavior in this patch, or the
behavior is not what you think it should be?  More elaboration of your point
would be helpful for me.

I don't get what counter you are asking about.  Could you please elaborate?

Thank you for this nice suggestion, I will change the comment so, in the next
version.
