Well, Mike mentioned that ultimately you want to interface this with
systemd? And we certainly have never been privy to any of these
uapi design conversations. Which is usually not a good sign...

fwiw

fd_context = fsopen("kexecfs")
fd_context = fsconfig(FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, ...)
fd_mnt = fsmount(fd_context, ...)

This gets you a private kexecfs instances that's never visible anywhere
in the filesystem hierarchy. When the fd is closed everything gets auto
cleaned up by the kernel. No need to umount or anything.

I'm not following this. See above. And also any umount can trivially
just destroy whatever resource is still left in the filesystem.

I'm not going to argue that you have to switch to this kexecfs idea
but...

You're using a character device that's tied to devmptfs. In other words,
you're already using a filesystem interface. Literally the whole code
here is built on top of filesystem APIs. So this argument is just very
wrong imho. If you can built it on top of a character device using VFS
interfaces you can do it as a minimal filesystem.

You're free to define the filesystem interface any way you like it. We
have a ton of examples there. All your ioctls would just be tied to the
fileystem instance instead of the /dev/somethingsomething character
device. The state machine could just be implemented the same way.

One of my points is that with an fs interface you can have easy state
seralization on a per-service level. IOW, you have a bunch of virtual
machines running as services or some networking services or whatever.
You could just bind-mount an instance of kexecfs into the service and
the service can persist state into the instance and easily recover it
after kexec.

But anyway, you seem to be set on the ioctl() interface, fine.
