Please be aware that BBML2_NOABORT midr list may not always imply BBLM2 
in ID registers (e.g., AmpereOne. But the plan is to fixup the per cpu
ID register - struct cpuinfo_arm64 - for such cores at early boot,
individually, before it is used for sanitisation of the system wide
copy).

That could work, but it introduces this "clearing" a capability, which
we don't do at the moment.

We had an offline discussion about this some time ago, with Mark
Rutland. The best way to deal with this is to change the way we compute
capabilities. i.e.,


1. Each boot CPU run through all the capabilities and maintain a per-cpu
    copy of the state.
2. System wide capabilities can then be constructed from the all early
    boot CPU capability state (e.g., ANDing all the state from all CPUs
    for SCOPE_SYSTEM or ORing for LOCAL_CPU).

But this requires a drastic change to the infrastructure.

Agree, every time I come back to the thread, I have to write down the
check and stare at it for a minute to agree with what it does. That said
it may be ideal solution for the short term. Or stick to what we do in
the patch currently, until we implement per-cpu capability proposal.
