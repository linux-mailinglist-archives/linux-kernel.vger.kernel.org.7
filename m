I did that and realised only bit later that I usually route SCMI clk driver
changes via clk tree.

clk: scmi: Handle case where child clocks are initialized before their parents

The SCMI clock driver currently assumes that parent clocks are always
initialized before their children. However, this assumption can fail if
a child clock is encountered before its parent during probe.

This leads to an issue during initialization of the parent_data array:

    sclk->parent_data[i].hw = hws[sclk->info->parents[i]];

If the parent clock's hardware structure has not been initialized yet,
this assignment results in invalid data.

To resolve this, allocate all struct scmi_clk instances as a contiguous
array at the beginning of the probe and populate the hws[] array upfront.
This ensures that any parent referenced later is already initialized,
regardless of the order in which clocks are processed.

Note that we can no longer free individual scmi_clk instances if
scmi_clk_ops_init() fails which shouldn't be a problem if the SCMI
platform has proper per-agent clock discovery.
