I only now realized what bothered me about "liveupdate". It's the name of
the driving usecase rather then the name of the technology it implements.
In the end what LUO does is a (more) sophisticated control for KHO.

But essentially it's not that it actually implements live update, it
provides kexec handover control plane that enables live update.

And since the same machinery can be used regardless of live update, and I'm
sure other usecases will appear as soon as the technology will become more
mature, it makes me think that we probably should just
s/liveupdate_/kho_control/g or something along those lines.

I think it would be nice to support auto-preserve sooner than later. 
reserve_mem can already be useful for ftrace and pstore folks and if it
would survive a kexec without any userspace intervention it would be great.
