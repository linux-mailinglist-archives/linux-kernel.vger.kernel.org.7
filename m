Right, I'm more broadly objecting to the patch and its premise, but
thought the exclusive filtering would at least mitigate its downsides
somewhat. You raise good points that it's not as clear cut.

IMO this is too subtle and unpredictable for everybody else. The
kernel can't see the future, but access locality and recent use is a
proven predictor. We generally don't discard access information,
unless the user asks us to, and that's what the madvise calls are for.
