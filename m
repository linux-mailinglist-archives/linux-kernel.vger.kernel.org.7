The supervisor OS must not expect a particular state of S-mode
CSRs other than what is defined in the boot protocol or the SBI
specification.

Like mentioned before, scounteren setup in KVM RISC-V and
OpenSBI is a HACK for buggy OSes which don't set up scounteren
CSR correctly when a HART comes-up. Even KVM user space
should not entertain such HACKs.

Forwarding HSM stop to userspace will slow down CPU hotplug
on Guest side. Further, this directly impacts SBI system suspend
performance for Guest because Guest is supposed to turn-off all
VCPUs except one before entering the SBI system suspend state.

Instead of inventing a new interface, we can simply improve the
ONE_REG interface to allow bulk read/write of multiple ONE_REG
registers which will benefit other architectures as well.

If required in the future, this bulk ONE_REG read/write interface
can also be used to load reset state of VCPU CSRs.

Nope, the approach taken by your patch is problematic because
for example userspace might disable SBI RFENCE or SBI PMU
with no means to implement these SBI extensions in user space.

We can't blindly forward an SBI extension to userspace when
userspace lacks the capability to implement this extension.

SBI SRST extension is implemented in kernel space because
we are re-using the existing KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT so
that we can also re-use existing KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT
related code on userspace side.

SBI SUSP and DBCN are already forward to user space and
we only have a minimal code in kernel space to ensure that:
1) In-kernel SBI BASE extension is aware of these extensions
2) These are forwarded to userspace only when userspace
    enables these extensions.

In addition to the above, we are blindly forwarding SBI
experimental and vendor extensions to user space so
user space can do its own thing by implementing these
extensions.

Anup
