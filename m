I only got some of the patches of the series, can you please send all of th=

not getting a lot of feedback due to that. :)

In general, I think it would be good to get GPU vendors to speak up to what=
 kind
of interfaces they're heading to with firmware schedulers and potential fir=
mware
APIs to control scheduling; especially given that this will be a uAPI.

(Adding a couple of folks to Cc.)

Having that said, I think the basic drm.weight interface is fine and should=
 work
in any case; i.e. with the existing DRM GPU scheduler in both modes, the
upcoming DRM Jobqueue efforts and should be generic enough to work with
potential firmware interfaces we may see in the future.

Philipp should be talking about the DRM Jobqueue component at XDC (probably=
 just
in this moment).

Some more thoughts on the DRM Jobqueue and scheduling:

The idea behind the DRM Jobqueue is to be, as the name suggests, a componen=
t
that receives jobs from userspace, handles the dependencies (i.e. dma fence=
s),
and executes the job, e.g. by writing to a firmware managed software ring.

It basically does what the GPU scheduler does in 1:1 entity-scheduler mode,
just without all the additional complexity of moving job ownership from one
component to another (i.e. from entity to scheduler, etc.).

With just that, there is no scheduling outside the GPU's firmware scheduler=
 of
course. However, additional scheduler capabilities, e.g. to support hardwar=
e
rings, or manage firmware schedulers that only support a limited number of
software rings (like some Mali GPUs), can be layered on top of that:

In contrast to the existing GPU scheduler, the idea would be to keep lettin=
g the
DRM Jobqueue handle jobs submitted by userspace from end to end (i.e. let t=
he
push to the hardware (or software) ring buffer), but have an additional
component, whose only purpose is to orchestrate the DRM Jobqueues, by manag=
ing
when they are allowed to push to a ring and which ring they should push to.

This way we get rid of one of the issue that the existing GPU scheduler mov=
es
job ownership between components of different lifetimes (entity and schedul=
er),
which is one of the fundamental hassles to deal with.
