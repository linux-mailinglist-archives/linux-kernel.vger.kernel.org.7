Yeah, so the problem is that SEV* is hardware that basically no active 
tester outside of the vendor (AMD) owns and is testing against 
development trees AFAICS.

I did a quick Git search, and here are a few examples:

For example, this commit from last summer:

  6c3211796326 ("x86/sev: Add SNP-specific unaccepted memory support")

... was only fixed recently:

  d54d610243a4 ("x86/boot/sev: Avoid shared GHCB page for early memory acceptance")

Or this commit from June 2024:

  34ff65901735 ("x86/sev: Use kernel provided SVSM Calling Areas")

... was only fixed a few days ago:

  f7387eff4bad ("x86/sev: Fix operator precedence in GHCB_MSR_VMPL_REQ_LEVEL macro")

Or this commit from June 2024:

  fcd042e86422 ("x86/sev: Perform PVALIDATE using the SVSM when not at VMPL0")

... was fixed a few weeks ago:

  8ed12ab1319b ("x86/boot/sev: Support memory acceptance in the EFI stub under SVSM")

Ie. bugfix latencies here were 10+ months.

Note that two of those fixes were from Ard who is working on further 
robustifying the startup code - a much needed change.

Ie. when Ard is asking for SEV-SNP testing for WIP series, which he did 
10+ days ago, you should not ignore it ... or if you do ignore his 
request for testing, you should not complain about the changes being 
merged eventually, once they pass review & testing on non-SEV 
platforms.

If you didn't have time to personally test Ard's -v2 series since May 
2, that's OK: I can merge these proposed changes in an RFT branch so 
that it gets tested in the daily testing flow. [see further below for 
the Git link]

In other words: please no "gatekeeping". Please don't force Ard into a 
catch-22 situation where he cannot test the patches on SEV-SNP, but you 
are blocking these x86 startup code changes on the grounds that they 
weren't tested on SEV-SNP ...

Here's Ard's request from May 2:

    https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250504095230.2932860-25-ardb+git@google.com

    "Again, I will need to lean on Tom to determine whether this breaks 
     SEV-SNP guest boot. As I mentioned before, I am still waiting for 
     SEV-SNP capable hardware to be delivered."

This request for testing was ignored AFAICS.

> something which Ard sent *on the same day*.

Sure: -v2 was sent more than 10 days ago, and the testing request was 
ignored AFAICS. Do 10 days count as 'ample time'?

Anyway, to make it even lower-overhead to test these changes, I've put 
the -v3 series into the WIP.x86/boot tree:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/tip.git WIP.x86/boot

Only lightly tested. Just a "boots/doesn't boot" kind of quick feedback 
would be much appreciated.

Note that naturally this tree is still subject to rebasing, as review 
feedback is incorporated.

Thanks!

	Ingo
