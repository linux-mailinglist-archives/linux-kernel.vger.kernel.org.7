The two CPUs in avc_reclaim_node() don't seem to be that odd, the
system's SELinux access vector/decision cache is full and the code is
purging some old entries so new entries can be added.  There is a
window where the AVC on one CPU can decide it needs to free some room
in the cache and start that process, but before it can actually make
progress on that and make some space another CPU also hits the AVC and
decides it needs more room.

The system does seem to be undergoing churn with respect to the AVC,
and if KASAN is enabled that likely adds an additional burden to all
of the AVC operations.  The avc_reclaim_node() code tries to empty up
to AVC_CACHE_RECLAIM/16 cache entries at a time, presumably to limit
the amount of time the per-bucket spinlock is held.  Without knowing
more about the reporter's system, it is hard to say for certain, but
it is possible that the AVC_CACHE_RECLAIM limit is too high given the
workload, KASAN, and other factors.  The fact that the lockup is
hitting when the CPU is trying to drop the spinlock and the IRQs are
firing tells me that the reclaim limit isn't too far off; it would be
interesting to see how much time the CPU spent processing the IRQs, I
wonder if that is a significant contributor.

We could make the reclaim limit smaller, but that would potentially
create more work for systems that can handle the current
AVC_CACHE_RECLAIM value, and it is worth noting that we haven't seen
widespread problem reports like this so I'm somewhat hesitant to start
messing with this limit.  Has anyone seen similar reports lately?

I imagine we could also do something to limit the number of CPUs
simultaneously trying to reclaim AVC space, but I don't think that's
the real problem here.

> ... and the third CPU is also in AVC code.

It is passing through the AVC/cache code and is querying the SELinux
policy directly because the requested access decision result is not
currently cached in the AVC.  As mentioned previously, this CPU
shouldn't be holding any SELinux/AVC related locks, although it is in
a RCU critical section.
