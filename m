I'm still sceptical here.

In the first snippet above, we describe a single IP block which provides
mailboxes and clocks.

In the second snippet we're saying that the IP block is a mailbox, and
then it somehow have a subcomponent which is a clock provider.

It seems to me that we're choosing the second option because it better
fits the Linux implementation, rather than that it would be a better
representation of the hardware. To the point that we can't even describe
the register range of the subcomponent...


Can you confirm that this is the path we want to go here?

Bjorn
