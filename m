Yeah, the only architecture-specific part there is the assembly chacha
implementation. And that will be the same one as used by regular x86.

Sounds good. And let me know if you want me to look at it.
Using the generic vDSO library and datastore is mandatory nowadays for
"real" vDSOs.

In emulation mode the trapping kernel will not actually trigger a
syscall but calculate the time in kernel space and write the results to
the respective registers. If I understand correctly the trap is handled
by the host kernel, so that would bypass UML completely.
My wording was a bit wonky. I stumbled upon this while looking for
potential time namespace compatibility issues. And with time namespaces
the chance for a clock mismatch between UML and the host are higher.
