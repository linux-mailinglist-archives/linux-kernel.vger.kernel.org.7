Agreed, though I think there's a "pure win" alternative that can be safely
implemented (but it definitely should be done separately).

If HLT-exiting is disabled for the VM, and the VM doesn't have access to the
various paravirtual features that can put it into a synthetic HLT state (PV async
#PF and/or Xen support), then I'm pretty sure GALogIntr can be disabled entirely,
i.e. disabled during the initial irq_set_vcpu_affinity() and never enabled.  KVM
doesn't emulate HLT via its full emulator for AMD (just non-unrestricted Intel
guests), so I'm pretty sure there would be no need for KVM to ever wake a vCPU in
response to a device interrupt.

Ooh, that's super helpful info.  Any objections to me adding verbose comments to
explain the effective rules for amd_iommu_update_ga()?

Ya, the need to flush definitely changes things.

I didn't do any measurements; I assumed the opportunistic toggling of GALogIntr
would be "free".

There might be optimizations that could be done, but I think the better solution
is to simply disable GALogIntr when it's not needed.  That'd limit the benefits
to select setups, but trying to optimize IRQ bypass for VMs that are CPU-overcommited,
i.e. can't do native HLT, seems rather pointless.

I saw this as well.  I'm curious if enabling GAPPI mode affects IOMMU interrupt
delivery latency/throughput due to having to scrape the entire IRR.
