Getting new people going is great, but if you were around for that
one you also know just how little usage it saw over time -- the ARMv8
big endian enablment has been on (minimal) life support with just some
downstream usage in vendor kernels. Adding the burden for everybody to
maintain this work forever is the flip side of the coin here.

MIPS has been doing some not so awesome things to the RISC-V architecture
in the last year or so. They've published patchsets that make it seem
like that they seem to have taken some old MIPS designs and done the
bare minimal conversion over to RISC-V, since they need their own weird
system peripherals and hooks. Again, with the burden for everybody to
maintain because their hardware engineers couldn't bother to develop a
full proper RISC-V core.

While I'm not happy with the lack of upstreaming from the (mostly
Chinese) SoC vendors, and we should be encouraging more of them to
contribute directly, MIPS seems to be making choices that might have
long term burden for all of us. So far the slope is slippery on the
system side, but needing to worry about BE support seems to be stepping
over the line for me without some obvious clear use cases that make sense.

Just because the ecosystem is flexible, doesn't mean you need to encourage
and support everything that gets built.

To me, it's not about the initial effort but about the (forever) work of
keeping it going without regressions. Now everybody will need BE CI, etc.

Hey Ben -- you posted a *RFC* of the patches in December 2024. I replied
to those. So did Palmer. With exactly these concerns. Did we get a
response from you? Nope.

So, seems like Linus has better success being impolite. That's a bummer.

For the RFC thread, see https://lore.kernel.org/all/Z2XLS2HX2KqBJW6U@chonkvm.lixom.net/
