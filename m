The thing is, absolutely none of our hardware/firmware/software stack
was designed in a way that would fit the drm_panel model. (Or, arguably,
drm_panel wasn't designed in a way that would fit our stack, in the
chronology of things.)

It's all one PCI device. All in the same MMIO space. The VBT (Video BIOS
Tables) contain all the information for the panels, as well as for
absolutely everything else about our display hardware. It's not separate
in any meaningful way.

Having a separate panel driver would get in the way. Having panel-edp
would get in the way. That's why there isn't a single x86 user for
drm_panel, AFAICT.

Yes, we only really need the drm_panel handle, to play ball with the
things that were built around it, specifically drm_panel_follower.

And we do need to allocate drm_panel ourselves. We're both the host and
the panel driver at the same time, and there's no benefit in trying to
articially change that. DRM infrastructure should provide frameworks
that are usable for everyone, instead of trying to force everyone into
the same model, whether it makes sense or not.
