But *how* are the other CPUs busy looping? Are they polling a variable? Where
does that variable live? The docs say that a high priority thread is run for
each CPU. So there at least needs to be a task struct and a stack. There are
some Kconfigs where the stack comes from the linear map, so if the variable that
is polls is on its stack (or even on CPU 0's stack then that's a problem. If the
scheduler runs and accesses the task struct which may be allocated from the
linear map (e.g. via kmalloc), that's a problem.

The point is that you have to understand all the details of stop_machine() to be
confident that it is never accessing the linear map. And even if you can prove
that today, there is nothing stopping from the implementation changing in future.

But then you have non-architectural memory accesses too (i.e. speculative
accesses). It's possible that the CPU does a speculative load, which causes the
TLB to do a translation and cache a TLB entry to the linear map. Then CPU 0
changes the pgtable and you have broken the BBM requirements from the secondary
CPU's perspective.

So personally I think the only truely safe way to solve this is to switch the
secondary CPUs to the idmap, then install the reserved map in TTBR1. That way,
the secondary CPUs can't see the swapper pgtable at all and CPU 0 is free to do
what it likes.

I think the potential for speculative access is the problem. Personally, I would
follow the pattern laid out by kpti. Then you can more easily defend it by
pointing to an established pattern.
