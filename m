Right, but this is why there's a flag for it. If you don't want to use it, you
don't have to.

I mean one can argue many things in the kernel are attacking corner cases, I
don't think that's an argument against a feature. mremap() _itself_ is a corner
case :)

On a longer-term aside: I'd like to address this in a far more broad fashion, in
fact I literally am now co-maintaining rmap with you largely because I want to
do this :P

So believe me, this is something that will be at least _tried_. But in the
meantime, the idea is we provide a means to work around a very major limitation
of anon remap.

I've addressed the suggestions from LSF/MM in the cover letter below.

I don't think this is possible, largely because of the issues around how we
figure out the anon_vma to attach to.

Main simpllifications are - we never touch anything CoW'd, we only allow 'true'
anon.

Well we focus on 'true' anon first (i.e. no MAP_PRIVATE) so we simplify that
way. Otherwise it's pretty complete.

I think you're forgetting folio->mapping also.

This is where a lot of the complexity is - it's rather chicken-and-egg. You need
to:

a. Know that you cannot currently merge with another anon VMA (and thus avoid
   having to do any of this).
b. Have a new VMA with an anon_vma to which you can relocate the folio.
c. Have that anon_vma locked...

Right.

Yeah we're getting into prctl, mctl hellscape here if we go down that road. And
I want to be conservative here. Having it as an mremap() flag doesn't prevent us
from later doing something policy-ish.

The code does that.

a.

Me too... hey I've run kernels with this flag just turned on by default and they
seemed fine ;)

Yes, so we have a sane fallback.

This is actually address future mprotect merges for instance (e.g. immediately
adjacent non-compatible VMA gets mprotect()'d to something compatible), or if
other VMAs are mapped adjacent to the moved VMA etc.

It just means, if you set this flag, and the operation succeeds, we will still
change vma->vm_pgoff and folio->index such that the VMA is mergeable with
immediately adjacent, compatible VMAs.

Yes me too. It's a complete horror show.

Well, the problem is if we encounter something at the folio level right? If
something is unexpected, what then? No matter what we have to clean up our
mess.

We do try our best to ensure that things will succeed.

Yes we should.

Addressed see later patches in series.

Well given the bug report in the thread , we also now have a failure to
obtain the folio lock because we hold PTE lock as a thing.

We could address that with lockless PTE traversal though.

Or we could do what we do in the folio_test_large() handling in
relocate_anon_pte() where we drop/reacquire...

We also have the case where, upon trying to split, we encounter a folio
which already has the currently locked anon_vma set. I can investigate
further how this can happen to determine if we can detect ahead of time.

Finally the folio split can fail...

I feel like we're on thin ice if we try to make an assumption that a
relocate can always succeed.

Well it's the only way to know if what you wanted actually happened or
not. I guarantee you, that people will complain if the issues they use this
to fix aren't always resolved by this.

They could also use for some retry logic potentially also.

It's useful for testing at the very least, very useful indeed so on this
basis it's worth having and doesn't add too much complexity.

I got a whole bunch of numbers, I mean things were always within the same
order-of-magnitude, however things are much slower if the existing logic
could just move a higher order page table entry rather than having to
traverse folios, obviously.

I do feel that mremap() perf shouldn't be a consideration given how
heavy-handed it is already as you say. But I'm not sure everybody will
share that view...

SLOC is a terrible measure :) I'd suggest counting how much of those are
comments... :)

The mremap() refactor added a bunch of SLOC but a lot of that was comments,
and breaking out very confusing logic into logical parts etc. It also added
more lines than that...

Unfortunately though trying to do anything like this involves added
complexity. I did try to keep it as minimal as possible...
