Think about it from my side.  I get hundreds of patches each day to
review.  If I see a v10 and then a patch with no version at all, what am
I supposed to do?  I would assume something went really wrong and just
delete this "obviously old" version as it would have been the first
version of the patch, especially as there was no version information
below the --- line.

So, what would you do in my situation?  What would you want to see if
you were in my situation?
