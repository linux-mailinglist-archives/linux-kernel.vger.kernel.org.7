nvec is one but this does not work for the reason above, it works
because of AFAICS (for the IWB set-up I have):

	msi_info = msi_get_domain_info(domain);
	if (msi_info->hwsize > nvec)
		nvec = msi_info->hwsize;

Not really, we test with wires above 32, we end up calling .prepare()
with the precise number of wires, don't know why that does not work for
the MBIgen (possibly because the interrupt-controller platform devices
are children of the "main" MBIgen platform device ? The IWB one is created
by OF code, MBIgen has to create children, maybe that's what is
going wrong with the device/domain hierarchy ?).

See above.

I supposed that's what its_lpi_alloc() does in its_create_device() but
OK, won't mention that any further.

Well, GICv5 will have to cope with designs, hopefully deviceIDs sharing
is a thing of the past I am not eulogizing the concept :)

We spotted it late March - planned to discuss the IWB design while
reviewing v5.
