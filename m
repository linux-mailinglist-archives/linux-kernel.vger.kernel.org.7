OK.  It shows how confusing the code is.  Normally in the Linux kernel
things defined with #define are fully capitalized, unless they refer to
some name from a hardware spec.

I'm a little surprised that there isn't some generic macro defined as
0xffffffff in the Linux kernel, but indeed I don't see one, and I see lots
of masks being defined as that.
