That's correct.

I like this idea. I will do this in the next version of the patch. I
have a couple of questions
about how to go about this if you don't mind.

First, should I drop the vaddr implementation or implement
DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD}
in vaddr as well? I am leaning towards the former because I believe
the paddr version is
more important, though the vaddr version is useful if the user only
cares about one
application.

Second, do you have a preference for how we indicate that we are using
the mempolicy
rather than target_nid in struct damos? I was thinking of either
setting target_nid to
NUMA_NO_NODE or adding a boolean to struct damos for this.

Maybe it would also be a good idea to generalize it some more. I
implemented this using
just weighted interleave because I was targeting the use case where
the best interleave
weights for a workload changes as the bandwidth utilization of the
system changes, which
I will go describe in more detail further down. However, we could
apply the same logic for
any mempolicy instead of just filtering for MPOL_WEIGHTED_INTERLEAVE. This =
might
clean up the code a little bit because the logic dependent on
CONFIG_NUMA would be
contained in the mempolicy code.

Makes sense. Based on your reply, I will probably change the code significa=

Yeah, I'll give more detail on the use case I was targeting, which I
will also include
in the cover letter of the next patch set.

Basically, we have seen that the best interleave weights for a workload can
change depending on the bandwidth utilization of the system. This was touch=
ed
upon in the discussion in [1]. As a toy example, imagine some
application that uses
75% of the local bandwidth. Assuming sufficient capacity, when running alon=
e, we
probably want to keep all of that application's data in local memory.
However, if a
second instance of that application begins, using the same amount of bandwi=
dth,
it would be best to interleave the data of both processes to alleviate
the bandwidth
pressure from the local node. Likewise, when one of the processes ends, the=
 data
should be moved back to local memory.

We imagine there would be a userspace application that would monitor system
performance characteristics, such as bandwidth utilization or memory
access latency,
and uses that information to tune the interleave weights. Others seemed to =
have
come to a similar conclusion in previous discussions [2]. We are
currently working
on a userspace program that does this, but it's not quite ready to be
published yet.

After the userspace application adjusts the interleave weights, we need som=
e
mechanism to migrate the application pages that have already been allocated=
.
We think DAMON is the correct venue for this mechanism because we noticed
that we don't have to migrate all of the application's pages to
improve performance,
we just need to migrate the frequently accessed pages. DAMON's existing hot=
ness
tracking is very useful for this. Additionally, as Ying pointed out
[3], a complete
solution must also handle when a memory node is at capacity. The existing
DAMOS_MIGRATE_COLD action can be used in conjunction with the functionality
in this patch set to provide that complete solution.

I agree this is a concern, but I figured DAMOS's existing quota mechanism w=
ould
handle it. If you could elaborate on why quotas aren't enough here,
that would help
me come up with a solution.

Answered above. I will include them in the next version.
