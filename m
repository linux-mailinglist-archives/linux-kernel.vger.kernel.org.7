Sure, is there any advantage? Your proposal seems more complicated at a first
glance.

Why is the argument flawed? Let's say we go with your proposal below, what would
the safety requirement for RawDeviceRegistration::new and the invariant of
RawDeviceRegistration look like? Wouldn't it be the exact same argument?

Exactly -- will change it to "increment the refcount" for clarity.

There's a reason why I keep them something with "DeviceRegistration" everywhere,
which is to make it clear that it's both a device instance *and* a registration,
which is actually rather uncommon and caused by the fact that device creation
and registration needs to be done under the misc_mtx in misc_register().

This is also the reason for those data structures to be a bit complicated; it
would be much simpler if device creation and registration would be independent
things.

It was UnsafePinned before, but Alice proposed to go with Opaque for the
meantime. Anyways, this is not introduced by this patch, it comes from
Christians patch adding T::RegistrationData.

Why? The reference is still valid in RawDeviceRegistration::new, no?

Do you want to propose an alternative comment about this?

Yes, I know, but I found the above a bit cleaner -- I don't mind changing it
though.

Sounds good! :)

But I think that unsafe is better than unwrap() in such cases; unsafe requires
us to explain why it's OK to do it, which makes it less likely to create bugs.

(Just recently I wrote some code, hit the need for unsafe and, while writing up
the safety comment, I had to explain to myself, why the way I was about to
implement this was pretty broken.)

unwrap() on the other hand, doesn't require any explanation, but panics the
kernel in the worst case.

No idea, I just tried to be complient with the existing style of the file. :)
