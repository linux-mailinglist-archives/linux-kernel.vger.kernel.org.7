FYI, I know some maintainers prefer a "RESEND" of a patch, but I personally
prefer a simple "ping" reply to the patch. Actually, I'll take either, but
my workflow is with patchwork[1] and I tend to give older patches in
patchwork priority. By sending a patch again via "RESEND" that patch will
supersede the older patch which actually pushes the patch further down into
the queue, which makes it even longer for me to see it (having the opposite
effect of the purpose of sending "RESEND").

When referencing functions, please add parenthesis "func()" when naming
them.

Also add newlines in the change log, to make it visually easier to read.

If you are going to use kerneldoc comments, might as well make it a
kerneldoc format: /**

Saying 0 or 1 should assume that those are the only values. Don't need the
content in the parenthesis.

Although this has newlines (which I like!), the indentation should be with
the first word after the hyphen. That is, instead of:

 * - If soft_disable is 1 a reference counter associated with the trace
 * event shall be increased or decreased according to the enable parameter
 * being 1 (enable) or 0 (disable) respectively.
 * If the reference counter is > 0 before the increase or after the decrease,
 * no other actions shall be taken.

It should be:

 * - If soft_disable is 1 a reference counter associated with the trace
 *   event shall be increased or decreased according to the enable parameter
 *   being 1 (enable) or 0 (disable) respectively.
 *   If the reference counter is > 0 before the increase or after the decrease,
 *   no other actions shall be taken.

Making it easier to read.

Would it be possible to group the requirements within "If soft_disable is
1"? Seeing three different lines starting with the same state seems
inefficient.

I have to find some time to make sure the above is correct. I'm looking at
this more at a superficial level. And I'll look at the rest later.
