Ahh, perhaps this is the crux of our misunderstanding... In my model, the split
primitive is called from __change_memory_common() (or from other appropriate
functions in pageattr.c). It's an implementation detail for arm64 and is not
exposed to common code. arm64 knows that it can split live mappings in a
transparent way so it uses huge pages eagerly and splits on demand.

I personally wouldn't want to be relying on the memory user knowing it needs to
split the mappings...
