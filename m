Hi again Kurt!

In case it helps for me to restate that, from my perspective, I can
say that I was maybe not thinking too terribly deeply, more at a
shallow level about the higher level workflow/process for a developer.
For example, with device attributes, it is loosely like this:

1. create functions to handle the actual getting and setting logic
which can become my show/store callback(s)

2. use DEVICE_ATTR_RW or similar macro to create my
device_attribute(s) -- the macro will expect callback functions that
follow specific naming convention from step 1

3. put one of more of my device_attribute(s) in a group (with optional
is_visible callback that also should be created)

4. my "device" is registered (through various mechanisms) while
passing in this attribute group as a parameter and everything is
created for me via the registration process

And this process is roughly the same with device attributes, driver
attributes, bus attributes, hwmon sensor attributes etc etc. so it is
very "familiar" to me (not saying that is "good" or "bad", but it is
nice that once you learn this process, you can sort of more quickly
understand what is happening as you encounter these various types used
in different places).

And from what I can tell as you mentioned in this patch, the process
for FW attributes would instead be something like .. ?

1. create functions or some way to handle the actual getting and
setting logic (but these are maybe not directly used as callbacks, but
instead used as one case within the logic of a more general
"show/store any property under the fw attr" callback)

2. create (or use an existing "standard"?)  enum with all properties
that should exist under my fw attr (display_name, current_value,
default_value, etc)

3. create said general show/store callback function for all properties
within the fw attr (display_name, current_value, default_value, etc)

4. use DEFINE_FWAT_OPS macro to create some fw attr ops for a specific
fw attr (passing the name and type)

5. build an array of fwat_attr_config whose entry is another struct,
but that struct can/will be built by another macro FWAT_CONFIG_AUX (or
similar) with all of its own properties for things like mode, the ops
from step 4, the properties enum from step 2, etc

6. put the attrs config in a new fwat_dev_config (with optional
is_visible callback that also should be created)

7. register the fw attr device with devm_fwat_device_register, passing
the fwat_dev_config and optional drvdata

(of course I could have easily missed something obvious or gotten
something totally wrong here, but hopefully I have captured the gist
of it!)

So I guess what I was trying to say was, the first process seems
easier and more intuitive for my simple mind to understand, whereas
the second process is a fair bit different from the others. Not that
one is necessarily better or worse than the other, but I guess I would
say that the first does feel more "simple" to me (though admittedly
these other attributes are more "simple" by design, of course!).

What I tried to convey before was more that my own personal "dream
scenario" with this is that I as a developer could essentially still
follow the first process I mentioned from above (the one for other
device attrs) and then in a "happy path" scenario I would only need to
focus on callback functions for my getting and setting logic (show
and/or store callbacks) and not have to write ANY other code.
Basically like this:

1. create functions to handle the actual getting and setting logic
which can become my show/store callback(s)

2. use FW_BOOL_ATTR_RW(name, display_name, default_value) or similar
macro to create my fw_attribute(s) --> NOTE that because I chose
"bool" here (in that I used the "BOOL" variant of the macro) then I
will automatically get all of the standard attributes like
display_name, current_value, language_code (maybe even that it
defaults to English unless I want to change it??), fixed choice of
possible_values (as the possible values are always the same for
booleans, I don't need to do anything with this part..) etc etc i.e.
there are standard callback functions for these standard things like
display_name etc and the developer does not have to implement them
(and similar variants could exist for enum, string, and numeric fw
attrs that take care of min/max properties etc)

3. put one of more of my fw_attribute(s) in a group (with optional
is_visible callback that also should be created)

4. my fw attr "device" is registered and the group is passed and
everything is created for me via the registration process

So *essentially* the process of this kind of fw attr implementation
would still be roughly the same as other attribute types, the code
would "look/feel/smell" the same as other attribute types, but I would
just need to pass a few extra parameters to the attribute macro in
order to set the display_name, default_value, etc properties that
would then get picked up by the "standard" show callback functions for
those attributes. The only thing I as an implementer really bother
with is the show/store functions and their actual getting/setting
logic on the actual device.

And bonus if the "standard" logic also enforces the various
constraints (e.g. it should always block to store something that is
not one of my given possible_values, or enforce the various min/max
rules, etc) so that I do not even have to write any of the code for
that part, either!

Maybe I am thinking of this too simply? I have not as mentioned
thought through all of the implementation details of this, but my
first guess is at least for these standard types (enumeration, string,
boolean, etc) is that it does seem like it is *probably* possible??
(not the extensions e.g. "authentication" etc -- needs more thinking
on that!)

Does this make sense, or are we saying the same thing, or maybe
"talking past each other" as they say in Swedish? :)

Thanks again and keep up the good fight!
