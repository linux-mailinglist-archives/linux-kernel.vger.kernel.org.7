I'm ok with the directory being cleaned up when it goes out of scope.
That makes way more sense overall, and will prevent leaks and other
messes.

For the C api, what I really don't like is when we were returning a
dentry to the caller, as then they had to manage it.  Ideally I didn't
want them to have to manage anything, hence the "lookup_and_remove"
function I added, all that was needed to remember is the name of the
directory, which the driver almost always already knew.

With Rust it's simpler, you can save off a reference and when it goes
away, it gets cleaned up.  You don't have access to the raw dentry,
which takes away my original objection, and if debugfs is not enabled,
there's no additional storage requirements.

So let's keep it simple here, and rely on lifetime rules when we can.

thanks,
