I originally gave up on the idea, but I feel kinda bad for Drew now, so
trying again:

No, "BASE probe function" is the sbi_probe_extension() ecall.

It's an existing IOCTL with a new data payload, but I can easily use
ONE_REG if you want to do everything through that.

KVM doesn't really need any other IOCTL than ONE_REGs, it's just
sometimes more reasonable to use a different IOCTL, like ENABLE_CAP.

Please don't repeat the design of SUSP/SRST/DBCN.
Seeing them is one of the reasons why I proposed the new interface.

"Blindly" forwarding DBCN to userspace is even a minor optimization. :)

Yes, KVM has to do what userpace configures it to do.

I don't think that implementing unsupported SBI extensions in KVM is
important -- they should not be a hot path.

No, SBI does not have to be implemented in KVM at all.

We do have a deep disagreement on what is virtualization and the role of
KVM in it.  I think that userspace wants a generic ISA accelerator.

Even if userspace wants SBI for the M-mode interface, security minded
userspace aims for as little kernel code as possible.
Userspace might want to accelerate some SBI extension in KVM, but it
should not be KVM who decides what userspace wants.
