Hi Johan,

...right...not sure how I botched this condition completely...my bad...
(even the comment is wrong :P...)

...I experimented with multiple version of this...so I suppose this is why...
...I will post a fixed V1 once I hacve a bit more feedback on the list...

My main aim here was to be able to define the quirk code as much as
possible in the proximity of where it is used...so that is clear what it
does and dont get lost in some general common table....and the macro was
a way to uniform the treatment of the static keys...

...but I am still not sure if all of these macros just degrade visibility
and we could get rid of them...would be really cool to somehow break the
build if the code "sorrounding" the SCMI_QUIRK changes and you dont update
(somehow) the quirk too...so as to be sure that the quirk is taking care of
and maintained...but I doubt that is feasible, because, really, how do you
even deternine which code changes are in proximity enough to the quirk to
justify a break...same block ? same functions ? you cannot really know
semantically where some changes can impact this part of the code...
..I supppose reviews and testing is the key and the only possible answer
to this..

> Does it even get compile tested if SCMI_QUIRKS is disabled?

It evaluates to nothing when CONFIG_ARM_SCMI_QUIRKS is disabled...
...so maybe I could add a Kconfig dep on COMPILE_TEST ....if this is what
you mean..

Ah right...I tested on a number of combinations BUT assumed only one
compatible was to be found...you can potentially add dozens of this
definitions for a number of platforms associating the same quirk to all
of them and let the match logic enabling only the proper on...BUT this
clearly does NOT scale indeed and you will have to endlessly add new
platform if fw does NOT get fixed ever...

That is abosutely the preferred way, BUT the match should be on
Vendor/SubVendor/ImplVersion ... if the platform properly uses
ImplementationVersion to differentiate between firmware builds...

...if not you will end up applying the quirk on ANY current and future
FW from this Vendor...maybe not an issue in this case...BUT they should
seriously thinking about using ImplementationVersion properly in their
future FW releases...especially if, as of now, no new fixed FW release
has ever been released...

Thanks for having had a look !
