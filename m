Still alive and kicking :)

You are absolutely right. Sorry about that.

Makes sense.

If we keep it that way, then I think we should change the description of
the binding. "Transfer PMIC to SNVS state at reset" tricked at least me
into believing it would actually make the kernel setup the PMIC to
go to SNVS state at reset.

Maybe someething like:

    PMIC is configured to go to SNVS state on reset. Bootloader or
    something else is responsible for configuring the PMIC to do this.
    The driver will not change this configuration when this property is
    present.

I guess back in 2019 when you introduced the rohm,reset-snvs-powered
binding you had to keep the code for writing to TRANS_COND1 in the
default case for backwards compatibility. But in hindsight, I think the
asymetry caused by not doing the same when rohm,reset-snvs-powered is
used is what caught me off guard.
But that is water under the bridge...

Got it.

Yes. But this specific configuration is not too late to do at driver
probe time, although it is better to do it as early as possible.

Yes, there is no way to know that fore sure. Even verifying the sanity
of the in-tree device-trees will require quite some work.

As of right now, not really. I am currently stuck with the existing
bootloader. I will replace it sometime later, and at that time, I can
make it configure the PMIC properly.

That should work, yes.

We could create another device-tree binding to make the driver override
PMIC configuration to use SNVS state on reset. But, in order to maintain
backwards compatibility with the rohm,reset-snvs-powered, I don't know
what to call it without adding more confusion. Maybe something like
rohm,force-reset-snvs-powered?

But although I found the bidning confusing at first, and currently is
not able to configure the PMIC before starting Linux, I agree that
it is better to have bootloader or something else handle PMIC
configuration, so it is setup as early as possible.
