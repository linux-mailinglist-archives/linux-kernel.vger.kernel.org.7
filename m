But you're adding the new file there? Just add it under
`rust/kernel/owned.rs` instead.

Yeah we could not implement `DerefMut` in that case (or only for `T:
Unpin`).

"wrapper" seems wrong, since a wrapper in my mind is a newtype. So it
would be `struct Owned(T)` which is wrong. The `T` is stored elsewhere.

I would expect that that happens, but sure we can leave it here.

Okay, in that case just say that `ptr` has exclusive access.

I'm also unsure, also for the correct trait bounds on this impl.
