I don't think it is possible to properly support nesting:

enter_lazy_mmu
    for_each_pte {
        read/modify-write pte

        alloc_page
            enter_lazy_mmu
                make page valid
            exit_lazy_mmu

        write_to_page
    }
exit_lazy_mmu

This example only works because lazy_mmu doesn't support nesting. The "make page
valid" operation is completed by the time of the inner exit_lazy_mmu so that the
page can be accessed in write_to_page. If nesting was supported, the inner
exit_lazy_mmu would become a nop and write_to_page would explode.

So the conclusion I eventually came to (after being nudged by Mike Rapoport at
[1]) is that this _is_ arm64's fault for creating a loop via
apply_to_page_range(). So I'm trying to fix this by breaking the loop.

We could alternatively use some per-cpu storage for a nest count, but that gets
ugly quite quickly I suspect. But regardless, I'm not convinced the semantics of
a properly nested lazy_mmu are safe.
