Hi Tejun,

Thank you for your feedback! You made a good observation that it's
really the duration delta that matters here. I looked at tracking the
time from when we set/clear a cgroup's CGRP_FREEZE flag and compared
that to the per-task measurements of its members. For large (1000+
thread) cgroups, the latency between when a cgroup starts freezing and
when a task near the tail end of its cset->tasks actually enters the
handler is fairly significant. On an x86 VM, I saw a difference of about
1 tick per hundred tasks (i.e., the 6000th task would have been frozen
for 60 ticks less than the duration reported by its cgroup). We'd expect
this latency to accumulate more slowly on bare metal, but it would still
grow linearly.

Fortunately, since this same latency is present when we
unfreeze a cgroup and each member task, it's effectively canceled out
when we look at the freezing duration for tasks in cgroups that are not
currently frozen. For a running task, the measurement of how long it had
spent frozen in the past was within 1-2 ticks of its cgroup's. Our use
case does not look at this accounting until after a task has become
unfrozen, so the per-cgroup values seem like a reasonable substitution
for our purposes!

That being said, I realized from Michal's reply that the tracked value
doesn't have to be as narrow as the cgroup v2 freezing time. Basically,
we just want to give userspace some measure of time that a task cannot
run when it expects to be running. It doesn't seem practical to give an
exact accounting, but maybe tracking the time that each task spends in
some combination of stopped or frozen would provide a useful estimate.

What do you think?
