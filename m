I do manually write each patch, but I don't have that global feel of the
API; but I do use my judgement to avoid some things:
   * I tend not to remove one side of an obvious pair of functions
     (e.g. a set/clear or an alloc/free)

   * I avoid things that look like a function for every firmware interface
     where the functions are almost documenting the interface.

   * I only bother deleting one line functions if it's part of a set.

and some others.  It's not automatic, but I don't claim to understand
the whole interface.  I will try and follow a thread if I end up deleting
something which then makes it look like something else isn't needed.
I do have _some_ feel - so have spotted some bugs where a function
should have been called.

OK, that's something I hadn't expected - I'd thought if one style was
used for many years, that the other was redundant.

It can be quite tricky to see why functions have ended up not being
used for years (or decades), some is making a nice API, but sometimes
it's people blindly copying another API or who had a set of patches
which used the function but those patches got abandoned.

It also varies a lot between maintainer - some really prefer not
to have unused functions at all.
