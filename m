Even that looked incorrect, as the v1 series only had one patch("[PATCH 
12/14] nvmem: make the misaligned raw_len non-fatal") that had fixes 
tag. Not sure how these 3 patches are tagged as fixes.

Its because this patch("PATCH 12/14] nvmem: make the misaligned raw_len 
non-fatal") is taken as fixup patch and wrapped into the original patch 
("nvmem: core: verify cell's raw_len"), Also the sha will not be valid 
for linus or char-misc tree.

All the patches related to this are enhancements to nvmem core to allow 
specifying bit offsets for nvmem cell that have 4 bytes strides.

Specially this check is also an additional check in core to make sure 
that cell offsets are aligned to register strides.

I can send them but its going to be exactly same series, I dont think 
anything will change as all of these patches are enhancements and there 
are no fixes.

I hope this clarifies a bit, Please let me know if you still want me to 
resend this series, which is going to be exactly same.
