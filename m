Hi Steven, many thanks for looking into this

Apologies, next time I'll ping instead of RESENDing (I recently
started following
this mailing list, so I was not aware).

Thanks, I'll change the commit msg in v2.

got it, will change in v2.

Now that I am reading this I realized that I missed the most important
discussion comments from v1, so I am adding them back here inline
below (BTW one more reason to avoid RESENDs):

While working on the documentation of __ftrace_event_enable_disable,
I realized that the EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_MODE flag is mainly used
internally in the function itself, whereas it is EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_DISABLE=
D
that prevents tracing the event.
In this perspective I see that, starting from the initial state, if for
a specific event we invoke __ftrace_event_enable_disable with enable=3D1
and soft_disable=3D0, the EVENT_FILE_FL_ENABLED is set whereas
EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_MODE and EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_DISABLED are not.
Now if for that event we invoke __ftrace_event_enable_disable again with
enable=3D1 and soft_disable=3D1, EVENT_FILE_FL_ENABLED stays set,
EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_MODE is set, while EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_DISABLED
remains not set. Instead if from the initial state we directly invoke
__ftrace_event_enable_disable with enable=3D1 and soft_disable=3D1, all
the status flag mentioned above are all set (EVENT_FILE_FL_ENABLED,
EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_MODE and EVENT_FILE_FL_SOFT_DISABLED).
Now I wonder if:
a) such a behaviour is consistent with the code expectation;
b) if it would make sense to have a standard enable invocation followed
   by a soft enable invocation to end up in the same state as a single
   invocation of soft enable;
c) eventually if we could get rid of the soft_mode flag and simplify
   the code to only use the soft_disabled flag.

Probably there are aspects that I am missing and I really appreciate
your inputs/views.

Agreed, will be changed in v2.

Possibly yes but IMO it would not save much; e.g:
  - if soft_disable is 1:
    - if the trace event reference counter is 0 before the increase or afte=
r
      the decrease, an enable value set to 0 or 1 shall set or clear the so=
ft
      mode flag respectively; this is characterized by disabling or enablin=
g
      the use of trace_buffered_event respectively.

    - if enable is 0 and the reference counter reaches zero and the soft
      disabled flag is set (i.e. if the event was previously enabled with
      soft_disable =3D 1), tracing for the trace point event shall be disab=
led
      and the soft disabled flag shall be cleared.

However IMO we can revisit this point after we have a discussion on the
considerations that were missed in the RESEND process and that are
now pasted above

FYI I also noticed here that "Context" is missing and "Returns" should be
"Return:", so I'll fix this in v2
