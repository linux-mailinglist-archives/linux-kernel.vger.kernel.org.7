Just tried booting into u-boot built from ArmSoM sources at [1] - same
issues as using mainline. Either I'm doing something stupid building
it (don't know what though), or the binary shipped in ArmSoM images is
indeed different from what the sources are.

FTR, my steps to build the vendor u-boot were:

make rk3576_defconfig
cp ~/rkbin/bin/rk35/rk3576_bl31_v1.15.elf bl31.elf
cp ~/rkbin/bin/rk35/rk3576_bl32_v1.05.bin tee.bin
make -j12
make u-boot.itb
./tools/mkimage -n rk3576 -T rksd -d
~/rkbin/bin/rk35/rk3576_ddr_lp4_2112MHz_lp5_2736MHz_v1.09.bin:spl/u-boot-sp=
l-dtb.bin
idbloader.img

Then I wrote idbloader.img to eMMC starting from sector 64, u-boot.itb
starting from sector 16384. It boots, but exhibits the same "stuck"
CPU frequencies as with mainline u-boot.

FWIW, I've managed to load Rockchip BL32 as OP-TEE with mainline
u-boot too: turns out the right address to load it is 0x48400000 and
not 0x08400000. It didn't help with the problem though.

Best regards,
Alexey
