It does, but that is still an improvement over the current
libpsx-based implementation in userspace.  That existing
implementation does not block, but it is running the risk that
prepare_creds() might fail on one of the threads (e.g. allocation
failure), which would leave the processes' threads in an inconsistent
state.

Another upside that the in-kernel implementation has is that the
implementation of that is hidden behind an API, so if we can
eventually find a better approach, we can migrate to it.  It gives us
flexibility.

I guess a possible variant (approach 1B) would be to do the equivalent
to what userspace does today, and not make all threads wait for the
possible error of prepare_creds() on the other threads.

Remark on the side, I suspect that the error handling in nptl(7)
probably also does not guarantee that, also for setuid(2) and friends.

commit_creds() is explicitly documented to never return errors.
It returns a 0 integer so that it lends itself for tail calls,
and some of those usages might also rely on it always working.
There are ~15 existing calls where the return value is discarded.

If commit_creds() returns -ERESTARTNOINTR, I assume that your idea is
that the task_work would retry the prepare-and-commit when
encountering that?

We would have to store the fact that the process is being
Landlock+TSYNC'd in a central place (e.g. group leader flag set).
When that is done, don't we need more synchronization mechanisms to
access that (which RCU was meant to avoid)?

I am having a hard time wrapping my head around these synchronization
schemes, I feel this is getting too complicated for what it is trying
to do and might become difficult to maintain if we implemented it.

It's unclear to me what you mean by that.

Do you mean that it is hard to replicate for Landlock the cases where
the pointer would have to be copied, because the LSM hooks are not
suited for it?


Here is another possible approach which a colleague suggested in a
discussion:

Approach 4: Freeze-and re-enforce the Landlock ruleset

Another option would be to have a different user space API for this,
with a flag LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_ENTER (name TBD) to enter a given
domain.

On first usage of landlock_restrict_self() with the flag, the enforced
ruleset would be frozen and linked to the Landlock domain which was
enforced at the end.

Subsequent attempts to add rules to the ruleset would fail when the
ruleset is frozen.  The ruleset FD is now representing the created
domain including all its nesting.

Subsequent usages of landlock_restrict_self() on a frozen ruleset would:

(a) check that the ruleset's domain is a narrower (nested) domain of
    the current thread's domain (so that we retain the property of
    only locking in a task further than it was before).

(b) set the task's domain to the domain attached to the ruleset

This way, we would keep a per-thread userspace API, avoiding the
issues discussed before.  It would become possible to use ruleset file
descriptors as handles for entering Landlock domains and pass them
around between processes.

The only drawback I can see is that it has the same issues as libpsx
and nptl(7) in that the syscall can fail on individual threads due to
ENOMEM.

If we can not find a solution for "TSYNC", it seems that this might be
a viable alternative.  For multithreaded applications enforcing a
Landlock policy, it would become an application of libpsx with the
LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_ENTER flag.

Let me know what you think.
