Agreed, even in the C case I find it confusing to sometimes deal with
indexes and sometimes with real thread/cpu numbers, but if we try and
at least keep the variables/parameter naming reflecting that, then it
should be bearable.

Maybe with some more thinking we can get something better? But I don't
have the bw now to think about it.

Right, I like the effort he is making into having perf more usable in
python, and I encourage him to think about the issues you raised so that
we can come to some good abstractions.
