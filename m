I guess we need two caps.

1. SYSTEM cap -> ARM64_HAS_BBML2. Based on the ID registers
2. An erratum -> ARM64_BBML2_ABORTS. Based on BBLM2==1 && !in_midr_list()


And then:

Without (1), we may enable BBML2 on a (system with) CPU that doesn't
have BBML2 feature.

And (1) can prevent any non-BBML2 capable CPUs from booting or (2) can 
prevent anything that aborts with BBML2.
