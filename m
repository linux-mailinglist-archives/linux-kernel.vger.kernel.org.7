Correct. You generally create a gem shmem object, and then you can call a
function to ask gem to create an sg_table and hand it back to you. I should
note my priorities have shifted a bit from trying to get shmem bindings
upstream, but currently it's still the best example I have of this usecase.

So, for gem shmem this means we can operate with an SGTable in two ways:

 * gem_shmem_object.sg_table() -> Result<&kernel::scatterlist::SGTable>
 * gem_shmem_object.owned_sg_table() ->
   Result<kernel::drm::gem::shmem::OwnedSGTable<T: DriverObject>

I'm going to call the first return type SGTable and the second one
OwnedSGTable, just so I can type a bit less.

The first, sg_table(), quite literally just calls drm_gem_shmem_get_pages_s=
gt
which attempts to allocate the table and return a pointer to it on success.=
 We
then cast that to &SGTable and return it to the user. This can be good for
usecases where we might only want to look up the SGTable once or twice, and
only need it for the duration of the & reference for the gem object. This a=
lso
skips needing to take a reference on the gem object as a result, so it's a =
bit
cheaper.

The second, owned_sg_table(), just calls .sg_table(), and then takes a
reference to the gem object on success and returns both as an OwnedSGTable.
This is for situations where we might be using the SGTable rather frequentl=
y,
e.g. beyond the lifetime of the & reference to the gem object, and we want =
to
avoid having to handle a fallible operation for initializing the sg_table e=
ach
time we use it. OwnedSGTable then just implements Deref<SGTable>, which let=
s
us use it pretty much identically to a raw SGTable.

With all of this being said though, I think this means we really have two
classes of operations around sg_table:

   1. Operations that are reasonable to make available on anything that
      provide a pointer to an sg_table, embedded or not. (iterating through
      pages immutably, checking the size of the table, etc.).
   2. Operations that are context-specific. For example: manually assigning
      pages would be context-specific since it relies on the context that
      we're the ones creating and allocating the table from scratch.

My reason for leaning towards having SGTable be a barebones wrapper that ot=
her
types can embed or point to is because I think that for any interface that
handles sg_table creation for the user, the most common class 2 behavior
across these interfaces is what the SGTable's lifetime is actually tied to =
and
where it comes from. For all of these interfaces, `P` (like in your example=
)
would be nearly identical implementations that just read from the embedded
sg_table anyhow. And we'd also have to have separate SGTable implementors f=
or
each interface even if the majority of them don't introduce much/any
specialized behavior. It's probably worth noting as well: if getting the
SGTable from gem shmem wasn't fallible then I likely wouldn't have even add=
ed
the OwnedSGTable type and simply stuck with an & reference to SGTable inste=
ad.

I think that this design also doesn't prevent us from abstracting more comp=
lex
behavior through traits anyway. If we had a DeviceSGTable and CpuSGTable, b=
oth
can easily embed a basic SGTable and then implement additional behavior lik=
e
mutable iteration through pages either through a trait that each type
implements or just through implementing such methods on the types themselve=
s.
And behavior in type 1 can just be exposed simply through implementing
Deref<SGTable> again.

Hopefully that makes sense? Let me know if I made any mistakes or need to
clarify anything though :)
