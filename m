But not on the function name, right?

I am still uncertain what guidelines to follow inside the kernel. Last
time I applied a patch in this situation, I had to remove it again. I
would rather not have to do that.

Perhaps the best way forward is if you send the patch with the naming
and argument type you think is best, and then we continue the discussion
on that patch?
