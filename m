Hi Mike,

I think I may have misunderstood your comments when we spoke at LSF/MM the other
day, as this statement seems to contradict. I thought you said that on x86 BPF
allocates memory using vmalloc_huge()/VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP and then it's
sub-allocator will set_memory_*() on a sub-region of that allocation? (And we
then agreed that it would be good for arm64 to eventually support this with BBML2).

Anyway, regardless, I think this change is useful first step to improving
vmalloc as it makes us more defensive against any future attempt to change
permissions on a huge allocation. In the long term I'd like to get to the point
where arm64 (with BBML2) can map with VM_ALLOW_HUGE_VMAP by default.

Thanks,
Ryan
