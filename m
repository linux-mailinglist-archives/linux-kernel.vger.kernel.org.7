Yes you are right. Thanks for correcting me.

As I mentioned in another fork of the thread. The nesting of traps is taken
care of by trap entry/exit. 
It's all about kernel induced event then.

Is there nesting of kernel induced event?
If there is no nesting then sure a field in `thread_struct` is fine.
But then in that case save/restore is in `pt_regs` is also fine and keep
a single image which truly represents current context and trap together.
