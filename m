I think this just dupes the compatible list and should be dropped.

This part is kinda stating the obvious I /think/ but might not be for
odd reason?

I think this part is confusing and should be dropped.

This part is based on platform, so should it not have an if/then/else
below restricting it to the correct platforms?

I think this dupes information in the items list in a more confusing
manner.

Sounds like another if/then/else should restrict this too.
Rest seems fine :)
