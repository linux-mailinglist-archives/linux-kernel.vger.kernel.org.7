As 0-day points out, I think this adds a new locking issue :(

But it's really hard to detect this, as you are doing both a revert and
a change in the same commit.  Can you make this as 2 patches, one that
does the revert which would be "easy" to review, and the second one that
does the new fix?  That way we can detect what is going on easier.

You also forgot to add cc: stable on this :(

thanks,
