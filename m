That works like a charm, thanks.

The only problem I ran into is that the man page for userfaultfd(2)
claims there's a handshake pattern where you can call UFFDIO_API
twice, once with 0 to enumerate all supported features, and then again
with the feature mask you want to initialize the API. In reality the
API only permits a single UFFDIO_API call because of the internal
UFFD_FEATURE_INITIALIZED flag, so doing this handshake requires
creating a sacrificial fd.

If the man page is not just totally wrong then this may have been an
unintentional regression from 22e5fe2a2a279.
