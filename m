As I understand it, PERST# should be only be deasserted after
all power rails are known to be stable.

This driver enables the regulator during probe, shortly
before calling dw_pcie_host_init().  That function calls
back to k1_pcie_init(), which enables clocks, deasserts
resets, and initializes the PHY before it changes the
PERST# state.

By "changing the PERST# state" I mean it is asserted
(driven low), then deasserted after 100 milliseconds
(PCIE_T_PVPERL_MS).

I have two questions on this:
- You say the PCI spec talks about the "right time" to
   deassert PERST# (relative to power).  Is that at all
   related to PCIE_T_PVPERL_MS?
- I notice that PERST# is in a deasserted state at the
   time I assert it in this sequence.  Do you see any
   reason I should assert it early as an initialization
   step, or is asserting it and holding it there for
   100 msec sufficient?

I have asked SpacemiT about this, specifically whether there
are additional interrupts (I don't think there are), or if
not that, additional registers to support MSI 32+ (see
below).  In their downstream driver they handle interrupts
differently.  I suspect num_vectors needs to be set to 32
(or I'll leave it unset and take the default).


In the DesignWare driver, there are up to 8 "ctrls", and each
ctrl has 32 bit positions representing 32 MSI vectors.  Each
can have an msi_irq defined.  An msi_irq is always set up for
ctrl 0.

For any ctrl with an msi_irq assigned, dw_pcie_msi_host_init()
sets its interrupt handler to dw_chained_msi_isr(), which just
calls dw_handle_msi_irq().

The way dw_handle_msi_irq() works, a single ctrl apparently can
handle up to 256 MSI vectors, as long as the block of 3 registers
that manage the ctrl (ENABLE, MASK, and STATUS presumably) are
consecutive in I/O memory for consecutive ctrls.


I looked for other examples.  I see that "pcie-fu740.c", which
supports compatible "sifive,fu740-pcie", sets num_vectors to
MAX_MSI_IRQS, but "fu740-c000.dtsi" defines just one "msi"
interrupt.  And "pci-dra7xx.c" seems to do something similar,
and maybe "pcie-rcar-gen4.c" too.

So this basically marks this controller as a pass-through device that
doesn't itself change state for runtime PM, but still communicates that
somewhere at or below it there might be devices that do participate.

OK, I think understand now.

Yes, it helps a lot.  Thank you.
