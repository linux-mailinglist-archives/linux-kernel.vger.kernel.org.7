Not strictly true. Some of them might have been initialized from
free_area_init() -> memmap_init() (the ones not eligible for deferred
init), which happens before KHO makes its memblock reservations.

I tried doing this when looking into this initially, but it doesn't work
for some reason.

    static void kho_restore_page(struct page *page, unsigned int order)
    {
    	unsigned int i, nr_pages =3D (1 << order);
=20=20=20=20
    	/* Head page gets refcount of 1. */
    	init_deferred_page(page_to_pfn(page), NUMA_NO_NODE);
    	set_page_count(page, 1);
=20=20=20=20
    	/* For higher order folios, tail pages get a page count of zero. */
    	for (i =3D 1; i < nr_pages; i++) {
    		init_deferred_page(page_to_pfn(page + i), NUMA_NO_NODE);
    		set_page_count(page + i, 0);
    	}
=20=20=20=20
    [...]

results in:

    [    0.644032] page:(____ptrval____) is uninitialized and poisoned

didn't dig any deeper on why it happens...
