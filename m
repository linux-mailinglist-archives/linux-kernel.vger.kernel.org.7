There is a dilemma for the hypervisor scheduler, as it has not too many 
good indicators on when to preempt a vCPU in favor of another one.

Assume we have a hypervisor facing high load. Among others, 1 VM with 2 
vCPUs running 2 tasks. Naturally, the scheduler in the VM would place 
each task on one of the vCPUs.

Assume further that, due to the high load, the hypervisor scheduler 
cannot schedule both vCPUs at the same time consistently. This means, 
that the hypervisor scheduler now decides which of the 2 tasks gets to run.

The scheduler in the VM on the other hand has better insights into which 
of the two tasks should execute. If the hypervisor can guarantee the 
guest, that certain vCPUs will be granted runtime on pCPUs consistently, 
the VM scheduler has a clear expectancy on the availability of its vCPUs 
and can make use of that information.

Essentially, we avoid forcing the hypervisor scheduler to take decisions 
which it does not have good information on. We'd rather let the VM 
scheduler take those decisions.

This requires of course, that the hypervisor can give a somewhat 
accurate estimate to the VM on how many CPUs it can safely use, which it 
should be able to do as it has the information on how much overall load 
is on the system, which the VM does not have necessarily.
A naive approach would be to just divide the available pCPUs through the 
number of VMs. The more interesting part will be to derive how many 
vCPUs can be overconsumed if other VMs are underconsuming.

In the end, both layers, hypervisor and VM, would take decisions which 
they have accurate information on. The VM scheduler knows about its 
tasks, the hypervisor knows about the overall system load.

I played around with the concept quite a bit. Especially if there is a 
lot of load on the VM itself and it tries to squeeze in short-running 
networking operations.
In this case the VM scheduler can take better decisions if it runs less 
vCPUs, but stays in full control, instead of relying on the hypervisor 
scheduler to schedule all its vCPUs.

The patches work as expected on s390.
