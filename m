Yeah, I started with that and then realized it has two drawbacks:

 * It will require larger changes in userspaces, because for
   example QEMU now first loads the initial state and then toggles the
   mp_state, which would incorrectly reset the state.

 * It will also require an extra IOCTL if a stopped VCPU should be
   reset
    1) STOPPED -> RUNNING (=3D reset)
    2) RUNNING -> STOPPED (VCPU should be stopped)
   or if the current state of a VCPU is not known.
    1) ???     -> STOPPED
    2) STOPPED -> RUNNING
    3) RUNNING -> STOPPED

I can do that for v3 if you think it's better.

Ok, I'll drop it from v3 -- it can be handled by future patches that
trap SBI calls to userspace.

The lack of userspace involvement is the issue.  KVM doesn't know what
the initial state should be.

Userspace would simply call the VCPU reset and set the complete state,
because the userspace exit already provides all the sbi information.

I'll drop this change.  It doesn't make much sense if we aren't fixing
the sbi_hart_start reset.

We already do have the mechanism -- the userspace will set MP_STATE of
VCPU 0 to STOPPED and whatever VCPUs it wants as boot with to RUNNABLE
before running all the VCPUs for the first time.

The userspace must correctly set the initial MP state anyway, because a
resume will want a mp_state that a fresh boot.

Yes, that is the design I was trying to change.  I think userspace
should have control over all aspects of the guest it executes in KVM.

Accelerating SBI in KVM is good, but userspace should be able to say how
the unspecified parts are implemented.  Trapping to userspace is the
simplest option.  (And sufficient for ecalls that are not a hot path.)

Thanks.
