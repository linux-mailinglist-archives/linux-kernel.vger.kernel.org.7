I don't think it needs to be that complicated, at all. But let's not
discuss the solution at this point, at least for me, that's too early.

However, I do understand your concerns and share them.

Right. I guess it falls in the SoC specific area and we need to live
with it, for now.

Anyway, the main reason why I joined the discussion is exactly because
of this. I have been working on enabling the same deep state for
s2idle as the one that corresponds to s2ram for some legacy arm64
platforms. To allow the system to wake up properly from this deep
state, I needed to save/restore these types of GIC registers.

I intend to post a complete series for this soonish. It should show
what is needed for a particular SoC in this regard. I will keep you
posted.

The FW could deal with this, but that would only work for platforms
with new or upgrade-able FW, which is not the case for these legacy
platforms that I am working on.

Moreover, we already implement the save/restore for some GIC variants
- and in some cases using different ways to do it. In my opinion it
would be nice to have a common solution that would only be enabled for
the states/platforms that really need it. In the series above I will
try to implement this, let's see if I can make it.

Kind regards
Uffe
