Yep, I'll take a look into combinig KSTATE with KHO.

kstate_field already have string with name of the field:

#define KSTATE_BASE_TYPE(_f, _state, _type) {		\
	.name = (__stringify(_f)),			\

Currently it's not used in code, but it's there for debug purposes

Absolutely agreed. I think we need to decouple restore and register, ie remove
 restore_misgrate_state() from kstate_register(). Add instance_id argument to kstate_register(),
so the PCI code could do:
            kstate_register(&pci_state, pdev, PCI_DEVID(pdev->bus->number, pdev->devfn));

And on probing stage (probably in pci_device_add()) call
        kstate_restore(&pci_state, dev, PCI_DEVID(bus->number, dev->devfn))

which would locate state for the device if any and restore it.

Yes, this needs more thought. Mutually exclusive flags could be moved in separate enum field.
 Some may be not needed at all. e.g. instead of KS_STRUCT we could just check if (field->ksd != NULL)

Agreed, I had similar thoughts. But this complicates code, so I started with
something simple.

I think vendors can just declare separate kstate_description with different ID.
The only problem with this, is that kstate_description.id is integer, so it would be
a problem to allocate those without conflicts.
Perhaps change the id to string? So vendors can just add vendor prefix to ID.

Hmm.. I'm not sure, there is a lot to think about.
 This might make changes in kstate_description painful,
e.g. if I want to rearrange some ->flags for whatever reason.
So how to deal with changes in kstate_description itself?

How do we save links to methods in kstate_field (->restore/->save/->count),
and what if we'll need to change function prototypes of these methods ?

Agreed.
