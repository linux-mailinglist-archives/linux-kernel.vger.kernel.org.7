Looking the kpti code further, it looks like kpti also allocates memory 
with the machine stopped, but it calls memory allocation on cpu 0 only. 
IIUC this guarantees the code will not be called on a CPU which was 
inside the allocator when it stopped because CPU 0 is running 
stop_machine().

My patch already guarantees repainting just run on CPU 0 (the boot CPU) 
because we just can be sure the boot CPU supports BBML2 so that we can 
repaint the linear map safely. This also guarantees the "stopped CPU was 
inside allocator" problem won't happen IIUC.
