There are several issues with the handling of CPUID and feature flags:

   1) The evaluation of the CPUID information is a complete maze and
      has been expanded as people see fit without ever thinking about
      a proper design.

      As a result many CPUID instances are read out a gazillion times
      to evaluate only parts of them and most of it is done with
      magically hardcoded constants and the most convoluted macros.

   2) The in memory representation is as stupid as it gets. Some CPUID
      features are stored as is, others are analyzed and individual bits
      are stored in some artifical bit field.

   3) There is no clear seperation between global and per CPU
      information. Real CPUID features are supposed to be global and
      identical accross all CPUs. Per CPU data in CPUID is information
      which is related to topologies of all sorts (APIC, caches, TLBs,
      power etc.)

   4) Drivers having access to CPUID is just wrong. We've had issues
      with that in the past because drivers evaluated CPUID themself and
      missed that the core code had stuff disabled.

So what we (mostly Ahmed) are trying to do here is to create a 1:1 view
of the CPUID information in memory with proper data structures, which
are generated out of the CPUID data base.

I know people will whine that this is waste of memory, but we are
talking about a few kilobytes of data and not about insane large structs.

That means we end up with something like this:

	union cpuid_info {
		unsigned long		bits[SIZE];
		struct cpuid_data	data;
        };

        struct cpuid_data {
        	struct leaf_0		leaf_0;
                struct leaf_1		leaf_1;
                ....
                struct leaf_N		leaf_N;
        };

Some of the leafs will be arrays, but that's a implementation
detail. Versus CPU feature bits this means that we are not longer
looking at a condensed linear bitmap of feature bits. but at a sparse
populated bitmap. The bitmap offsets of the individual feature bits are
computed at build time and not longer hardcoded in some horribly
formatted header file.

This allows to:

     1) Read _all_ CPUID information once into memory

     2) Make _all_ subsequent CPUID related operations memory based

     3) Remove CPUID() from drivers and other places and let them retrieve
        the information out of the relevant leaf structures by doing

            if (!info->data.leaf_N.foo_enabled)
            	return;
            foo = info->data.leaf_N.foo;

        instead of

            cpuid($N, eax, ebx, dummy1, dummy2);
            if (!(eax & MAGIC_NUMBER))
            	return;
            foo = MAGIC_MACRO_MESS(ebx);

        That also makes sure that everything in the kernel looks at a
        consistent piece of information, especially when the boot code,
        mitigations, command line options etc. disabled certain features.

Now what about software defined (artificial) feature bits including BUG
bits?

We still need them and there is no reason why we would replace them with
something else. But, what we want to do here, is basically the same as
we do for the real CPUID information:

   Create and document real artifical leafs (there is enough reserved
   number space in the CPUID numbering scheme) and put those into the
   CPUID database as well.

   That allows to handle this stuff in the same way as any other CPUID
   data and the autogeneration of bit offsets and text information for
   cpuinfo just works the same way.

Coming back to the original question with the example of LA57 and the
actual enablement. There is no reason why we can't have the actual CPUID
bit and a software defined bit.

The way how this should work is:

    1) The CPUID info is in data.leaf_07.la57

    2) The enablement bit is in data.leaf_linux_N.la57 or such

The CPUID database contains the entries for those in leaf_07:

      <bit16 len="1"  id="la57"                    desc="57-bit linear addresses (five-level paging)">
        <vendors>
          <vendor>Intel</vendor>
          <vendor>AMD</vendor>
        </vendors>
        <linux        feature="true"               proc="false" />
      </bit16>

and leaf_linux_N:

      <bit3 len="1"  id="la57"                     desc="57-bit linear addresses (five-level paging)">
        <vendors>
          <vendor>Linux</vendor>
        </vendors>
        <linux        feature="true"               proc="true" />
      </bit3>

As the "proc" property of leaf_07.la57 is false, the bit won't be
exposed in cpuinfo, but the software defined bit will.

This also means, that we switch to a model where the software defined
bits are not longer subject to random introduction and removal. We
simply keep them around, mark them as not longer used and introduce new
ones with proper documentation. That requires due process, which
prevents the adhoc messing around with feature bits, which has us bitten
more than once in the past.

Aside of code clarity and simplification there is another benefit of
having such a proper defined and documented view:

  Analysis in crash dumps becomes easy for tooling because both the
  kernel and the tools can rely on machine generated data which comes
  from a single source, i.e. the x86 cpuid data base.

Versus global and per CPU information.

Global information contains:

  - all feature bits, which can be mapped into the X86_FEATURE machinery

  - all globally valid information which is only accessed via software,
    e.g. the name string or some numerical data, which is the same on
    all CPUs

Per CPU information contains:

  - all leafs which truly contain per CPU information (topology, caches,
    power ...)

This will obviously take some time to hash out and implement, but in the
long run this is the right thing to do.

Thanks,

        tglx
