Well, I am not sure that is quite true. The problem is that it seems to 
be a major blocker for things like sysfs and configfs devicetree overlay 
patches. And if we go with the global route, well, we are pretty much 
re-implementing those patches. Maybe we can add some way to check that 
only i2c-connecotr, spi-connector etc parent nodes for a add-board 
connector are modified, but well, not sure if that is enough.

Not quite, removal is a very important part of the equation, specially 
for mikroBUS. mikroBUS iteself is not exactly hot-pluggable, but Beagle 
has a usecase of mikroBUS over greybus (over 6lowpan). Since the node 
can be removed, you now have a setup where mikroBUS becomes removable.

By ids do you mean I2C address or the driver id?

What I was mentioning here is as follows:


add-board:

```

&CONNECTOR_I2C {

     sensor: sensor@12 {

         ...

     };

};

```


We apply the same addon board overlay to connector A and connector B. 
And CONNECTOR_I2C is same for both connectors.


This will resolve to:


```

&CONNECTOR_I2C {

     ...

     sensor: sensor@12 {

         ...

     };

};

```


There will be no errors but the sensor would be registered only once.


In case of a local system, 2 sensor nodes will be present in the global 
devicetree, and one of the sensors will fail during registration.

You can see the current devicetree at `/sys/firmware/devicetree`, so 
there is that.


Also, when applying devicetree overlay, if the node already exists, the 
properties are over written. The overlay application will not fail. And 
in many cases, the property changes will not even be handled by the 
sensor/device driver.

Also, things like `/delete-node/` and stuff do not work in overlays.

Well, I wanted to try an upstream first approach, specially since 
everyone else has given up on upstream. The current situation is quite 
messy. mikroBUS in the wild uses modified greybus manifest. In fact, 
there are official guides that show the greybus manifest approach. But, 
those patches were rejected last year, with the suggestion that upstream 
wants devicetree to be used for this purpose. Btw, manifest was already 
in use for 4 years at that point with greybus manifest for 100s of 
addon-boards.


So I was hesitant to have a 2nd out of tree approach for the same. But 
at this point, it does seem more productive to just go the vendor tree 
route for now and try again in a few years.
