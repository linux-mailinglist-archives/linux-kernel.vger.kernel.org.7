Ok. So does it mean that the issue described here applies also for POSIX
SMB server?

If yes, then I would propose to first fix the problem with
Windows/non-POSIX SMB server and then with others. So it is not too big.

Currently (without this patch series) it is CIFSSMBRenameOpenFile()
function when called with NULL as 3rd argument.

Cleanup is done in PATCH 11/35, where are more details.

Originally the "Silly rename" is the term used by NFS client, when it
does rename instead of unlink when the path is in use.
I reused this term.


So for SMB this "silly rename" means:
- open path with DELETE access and get its handle
- rename path (via opened handle) to some unique (auto generated) name
- set delete pending state on the path (via opened handle)
- close handle

(plus some stuff around to remove READ_ONLY attr which may disallow to
open path with DELETE ACCESS)

So above silly rename means that the original path is not occupied
anymore (thanks to rename) and the original file / dir is removed after
all clients / users release handles (thanks to set delete pending).

It is clear now clear? Or do you need to explain some other steps?
Sometimes some parts are too obvious for me and I unintentionally omit
description for something which is important. And seems that this is
such case. So it is my mistake, I should have explain it better.
