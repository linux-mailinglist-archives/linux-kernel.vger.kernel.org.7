I don't think that such device resources exist from a semantical point of view.

We always have to guarantee that a driver released the device resources once the
corresponding device is unbound from the driver.

However, there certainly are differences between how fatal it is if we don't do
so.

Complementing your example below, if we for instance fail to release a memory
region in time, a subsequent driver probing the device may fail requesting the
corresponding region.

You can, just like for every other registration (e.g. class devices, such as
misc device), but it's sub-optimal, since then we could not treat the
registering device of the registration as &Device<Bound>, which allows direct
access to device resources with Devres::access(). Please see also [1] and [2].

We have two (safe and correct) ways to access device resources, one is the
runtime checked access through Revocable::try_access() (which implies the RCU
read-side critical section and atomic check); the other one is the compile-time
checked access through providing a &Device<Bound> as cookie for directy access
without runtime overhead.

Wherever possible, we want to enable the latter, which means that registrations
need to be properly guarded.
