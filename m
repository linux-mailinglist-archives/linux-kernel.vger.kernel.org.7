I don't recall discussing this particular aspect at Plumbers, so sorry
if we're coming back to the same discussion we had.

I'm not necessarily opposed to changing the MIPI-DSI bus API, but I
don't think changing the semantics to remove the fact that a particular
device is connected or not is a good idea.

I would have expected to have bus driver (maybe) take a device pointer
at attach, and drop it at detach.

Then, when we detect the hotplug of a DSI device, we detach it from its
parent, and we're done.

What prevents us from using that approach?

Maxime
