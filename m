Ah, you mean in the absence of pagefault_disable()..pagefault_enable().

The page fault handling code uses faulthandler_disabled(), which checks
whether either pagefault_disabled() or in_atomic() are true, and aborts
if either are. Given that, using pagefault_disable() should work fine on
PREEMPT_NONE.

Yep, in the absence of pagefault_disable().

I think you mean the kerneldoc comment for __copy_to_user_inatomic(),
which says:

| The caller should also make sure he pins the user space address
| so that we don't result in page fault and sleep.

... and I think the key aspect is to avoid the sleeping, and actually
taking a fault (and failing the uaccess) has to be fine, or the _nofault
API (which uses the _inatomic API) is broken by design.

I think the bit about pinning the address space is misleading.

I agree. In almost all situations it's better for code to use the
_nofault API.

Mark.
