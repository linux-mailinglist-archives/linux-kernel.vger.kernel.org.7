+ adding pcie-brcmstb.c folks

Apologies if a quick self-reply is considered nosiy or rude, but I
nearly forgot that I previously was looking at "pwrctrl"-like
functionality and noticed that drivers/pci/controller/pcie-brcmstb.c has
had a portion of the same "pwrctrl" functionality for some time (commit
93e41f3fca3d ("PCI: brcmstb: Add control of subdevice voltage
regulators")).

Notably, it performs its power sequencing before starting its link, for
(I believe) exactly the same reasons as I mention below. While I'm sure
it could theoretically be nice for them to be able to use
drivers/pci/pwrctrl/, I expect they cannot today, for the same reasons.

P.S. My original post is here, in case you're interested:

I also leave the rest of the message intact below.
