There are other USB serial devices that support multiple ports over a
single USB interface. The DT bindings need to account for that case as
well, and that probably means we should not be describing the interfaces
at all but rather the physical ports.

You will also see the following kind of warnings in the logs:

ttyUSB ttyUSB0: tty_hangup: tty->count(1) != (#fd's(0) + #kopen's(0))
ttyUSB ttyUSB0: tty_port_close_start: tty->count = 1 port count = 0

which are due to the fact that serdev does not support hangups which are
used during teardown of USB serial ports.

I skimmed the code to verify that the issue is still there, and even
forward ported my patches to confirm that that you would still see the
port count warnings that indicate that something is amiss.
