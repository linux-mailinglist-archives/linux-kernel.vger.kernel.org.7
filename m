I went back through the thread and the referenced threads and I can't
find any details on the USBAN splat. Can that please get reproduced in a
commit log? That would help understand if it's a false positive or not.

Also, referencing the commit would be good. I assume this is discussing
commit 15fcedd43a08 ("kexec: Annotate struct crash_mem with __counted_by")?

Given that this makes things work correctly with newer compilers, I
would say it should be backported to whatever -stable kernels have the
"counted_by" annotation. (Hence the request to add a "Fixes" line so
that it will happen automatically.)
