Hi Yosry,

Thank you for getting back to me! I hope you are enjoying your leave : -)

Yes -- but I am calling remove_mapping() to unfreeze with a refcount of 1
(zswap is now the sole owner of the page).

Yes! I changed reclaim logic to be aware that zswap can do this, so there
is a new switch case that simply continues through the folio list when
zswap steals the incompressible page (but we don't want to drop the page).

Yes, sorry for the ambiguity -- this was specifically for the writeback
disabled case. My focus currently is on reducing the amount of CPU cycles
spent stuck on trying to compress incompressible pages.

Yes, Nhat and Shakeel have both offered the same perspective. I'm currently
working on this approach with help from Nhat.

This makes sense to me. I'll take this into consideration when writing
benchmarks for this patch!

Yes -- hopefully, keeping it in swapcache allows us to reap the benefits of
both worlds, minus the duplicated allocation / copying.

This is a good point. While I don't have the numbers to back this up, I have
an intuition that this patch really sees the most benefits from reducing
CPU time spent trying to compress incompressible pages, rather than from
maintaining a better LRU ordering. For that reason I also suspect that we
see much better performance gains when writeback is disabled. Following that
logic... maybe there is some future work to be done that just moves these
incompressible pages to an unevictable LRU when writeback is disabled?

For now, I'm still experimenting with keeping the page in swapcache. I'll
be sure to report back with cool findings! Thank you again for your review
of this idea Yosry, I hope you have a great day!
Joshua
