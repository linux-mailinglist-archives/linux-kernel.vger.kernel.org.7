Hi Arnd,

Thank you for your detailed review and suggestions. I have addressed all the 
issues you raised in v2 of the patch series.

Fixed. Updated the Kconfig description to mention "Black Sesame Technologies 
BST C1200 controller" and moved the config entry to the correct alphabetical 
position between MMC_SDHCI_BCM_KONA and MMC_SDHCI_F_SDH30.

Agreed. Removed the unused phy_crm_reg_base and phy_crm_reg_size fields from 
dwcmshc_priv structure and replaced the manual platform_get_resource() + 
ioremap() calls with devm_platform_ioremap_resource().

Good suggestion. Replaced bst_write_phys_bst() and bst_read_phys_bst() with 
bst_crm_write() and bst_crm_read() that take sdhci_pltfm_host pointer and 
offset parameters for better encapsulation.

Fixed the comment to correctly state 32KB.

You're absolutely right. I've enhanced the comment with a detailed explanation 
of our specific hardware constraints:

1. System memory uses 64-bit bus, eMMC controller uses 32-bit bus
2. eMMC controller cannot access memory through SMMU due to hardware bug
3. Our SRAM-based bounce buffer solution works within 32-bit address space

I appreciate your optimism about finding alternative solutions. Unfortunately, 
we have thoroughly investigated these approaches:

Regarding these last two suggestions, I'm not very familiar with the implementation 
details. Could you provide more guidance on:

1. **dma-ranges approach**: We tried adding these properties to the device tree:
   ```
   dma-ranges = <0x00000000 0x00000000 0x100000000>;
   dma-mask = <0xffffffff>;
   ```
   However, we still encounter DMA addressing issues. Are there specific 
   examples in other drivers we could reference for similar hardware constraints?

2. **Moving RAM start position**: Which component would control this configuration? 
   Would this require bootloader parameter changes or SoC-level configuration?

We're certainly interested in exploring these alternatives if they could provide 
a more elegant solution than our current bounce buffer approach.

The v3 patch addresses all your code structure and documentation concerns 
while providing a clear explanation of why this approach is necessary for 
our platform. I have also fixed compilation warnings about unused variables 
that resulted from the refactoring.

**Current DMA Issues**: Despite setting DMA32_ZONE, we still encounter DMA 
addressing warnings. Key error messages include:
```
DMA addr 0x00000008113e2200+512 overflow (mask ffffffff, bus limit 0)
software IO TLB: swiotlb_memblock_alloc: Failed to allocate [various sizes]
```

This confirms our hardware limitation where the eMMC controller cannot access 
memory above 32-bit boundaries, even with ZONE_DMA32 configured.

The complete kernel log with detailed DMA allocation failures and warnings
is available at: https://pastebin.com/eJgtuHDh

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have suggestions
for alternative approaches.

Best regards,
Albert
