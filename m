Right but that was only one reason why the timer interrupts where
staggered.

But then the tick also executes other code that can cause contention. Why
merge such an obvious problematic patch without considering the reasons
for the 2007 patch?

And then issues resulted because the scaling issues where not
considered when merging the 2010 patch.

As pointed out in the patch description: The synchronized tick (aside from
the jitter) also causes power spikes on large core systems which can cause
system instabilities.

We can get to that but I at least need some direction on how to approach
this and figure out the concerns that exist. Frankly my initial idea was
just to remove the buggy patches since this caused a regression in
performance and system stability but I guess there were power savings
concerns.

How can we address this issue in a better way then? The kernel should not
come up all wobbly and causing power spikes every tick.
