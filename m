Thanks for taking the time to write this extensive reply. I agree on the 
arguments provided here.

I agree on this statement. I just wanted to remark I didn't know that 
during the pit_timer_init() call can't be concurrency on the lock at 
all. I do know now, tho. Thanks for explaining.

I will provide a new patch with your suggestion to use scoped_guardian() 
and wording the commit message and description properly.

Thanks,
ffmancera.
