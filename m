Hello Al,

first thanks a lot for your guidance and insightful perspective and
your advice was incredibly valuable, very valuable.
And not just for this specific patch but also in helping us understand
how to approach bugs and testing in kernel world.

it really clarified how things that look like straightforward fixes
can actually be symptoms of deeper design decisions and why blindly
patching based on heuristics can lead us astray.
So your mentorship reminded us that understanding the why behind
kernel code is way more important than just code and that thoughtful
investigation is key in kernel development.

When examining every new technology (ai, openai codex) i think we need
an engineering perspective but you should know that i didnt send it
with a very short research, sorry.
and i didnt think about whether rcu should leave this open while doing
read copy and what would happen if it did but you said it very well,
so this was enough of a guide for me and i will definitely look into
it and try to understand it better by going to for example git blame
and grep.
I actually thought i understood this code and fix but that was it and
i just believed the patch was correct without any need for static
analysis or heuristic warnings.

Still we live with these, i mean ai or many other tools come into our
lives and this is also a learning phase for me, i need to learn more.
and i actually asked ai tool this again and this time it got a better answe=
r:

"rcu locks are complex, it is not enough to just appear to be missing.
why does it appear to be missing? look at the entire code, how is the
lock/unlock balance provided?
look at past commits, why does it appear that there is no unlock there?
look at similar codes, is it intentional to act like this in that place?
experiments, tests, asking questions are a must.
in other words, do not ask =E2=80=9Cthe tool warned, let=E2=80=99s patch it
immediately=E2=80=9D but =E2=80=9Cwhy is there such a warning, is it really=
 a
problem?=E2=80=9D
"

this is a pattern i dont normally see elsewhere in kernel and i was
convinced that the switch was left open.
i learned that rcu_read_lock shouldnt be missing and it actually
improved my approach to kernel.

so thank you again.

Regards

Ozgur
