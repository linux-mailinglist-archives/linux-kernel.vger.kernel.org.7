Sure, if that saves memory that would be a good change.

I feel like the creation time here is odd, but if others really
need/want it we could take it.  I would like to see others review it
though.

Many programs read the kernel log for various reasons, that's why we
have some common macros/functions for displaying data properly there,
like the dev_err() call.
