Yes, your patchset delays all commands. In fact, some distinction needs =
to be made:
commands with path errors and those that haven't been sent yet can be =
failed over
immediately. You might consider applying the delay only to commands with =
status
NVME_SC_HOST_ABORTED_CMD.

In your patch as shown below, I think nvme_schedule_failover should be =
called after
nvme_rdma_teardown_admin_queue for two reasons:

* nvme_rdma_teardown_io_queues will call nvme_cancel_tagset, and then =
the inflight
  commands will be added to the ctrl's request_list. So =
nvme_schedule_failover should be
  after nvme_rdma_teardown_io_queues to kick them.

* This does not follow the rule of starting the delay timer(aka =
nvme_schedule_failover)
   after all communication is stopped.

I agree that introducing a controller-level queue is necessary, these =
commands pending
retry should be uniformly delayed after the controller finishes =
disconnecting.

Regarding the issue of multiple connections and disconnections, in my =
patchset I avoided
using delayed_work, and instead used a synchronous msleep approach. This =
prevents
premature retries.

If we use delayed_work, the following issue may arise: during a =
controller reset, suppose
an inflight command (command 1) is canceled and added to the =
controller=E2=80=99s request_list,
then the connection is torn down and nvme_schedule_failover is called. =
Command 1 will
be scheduled to retry after 30 seconds. And then the reconnection =
completes, but
command 2 encounters an I/O timeout and is also added to the =
request_list. At this point,
the 30-second delay expires, and command 2 might be mistakenly retried =
immediately.

The current state machine cannot avoid this issue if using delayed_work.

Thanks,
Jiewei=
