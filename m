If someone can come up with a fuzzed file system that can cause
fsck.ext4 to crash, or which fsck.ext4 can't fix said corruption such
that any kernel in the last 5 years (or heck, I'll be generous,
*ever*) results in a kernel crash or vulnerability, feel free to file
the security bug against e2fsprogs.

The last time an image triggered a e2fsck crash was three years ago
(CVE-2022-1304), and the last time that fsck.ext4 failed to fix a
corruption which could trigger a kernel issue was six years ago
(CVE-2019-5094).

My only caveat here is that it needs to be a real crash --- if it's
some bullsh*t fuzzer that treats e2fsck using more than 6 megabytes as
a "security vulnerability" that I have to fix in 30 days or "we will
tell the world", I'll stop engaging with the fuzzer project (i.e.,
oss-fuzz).  As far as I'm concerned, calling things like this a
security vulnerability says a lot more about fuzzer project than
e2fsprogs.  There are security research labs (such as TALOS) that can
send me security reports for e2fsprogs that doesn't waste my time.

In any case, if fsck can't fix the problem, then it's a e2fsprogs CVE,
not a kernel CVE --- so it's not something the kernel cVE process
needs to take into account.  If it's a corrupted file system image,
then fsck.ext4 should fix it, and if it can't, that's an e2fsprogs issue.

I think classifications should be tied to what develoeprs say is a
valid way to use their code.  If users do something irrresponsible,
that's the user's fault.  And if the product ships the system in an
insecure default, then it's a security problem with the product.
