Alright.
Let's go back to the previously proposed "mediatek,hardware-voter" way then.

Regarding that to be a single clock controller, I'm afraid that won't really be
possible because not all clocks in a single domain are voted - especially the
mux-gate clocks can't really be put in one single clock controller because to
manage those we have to write to the HWV *and* to the clock controller MMIO in the
same operation in order to actually manage the clock.

If that wasn't the case, I would've been happier to have all of the HWV clocks in
one clock controller (even though those belong to different SoC subsystems)...
...but let's see if we can (and if it makes sense to) aggregate at least some!

Thanks everyone!

Cheers,
Angelo
