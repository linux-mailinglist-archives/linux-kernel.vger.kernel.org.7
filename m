I believe the examples I provided for arbitrary ordering can be considered
a detailed technical reason.

Thank you for the detailed explanation. I think I understood the core points of this concept
What I wrote was simply my interpretation — that it can be
viewed as a well-defined extension of maintaining equal priority dependency
together with inclusion/exclusion semantics. Nothing more and nothing less.

Through this discussion my intention is to arrive at the best solution,
and I appreciate that you pointed out areas I should reconsider. If you,
and other reviewers(If somebody gives opions of it, then it will be helpful)
generally conclude that the tier concept is the right path,
I have a clear willingness to re-propose an RFC and patches
based on your idea. In that case, since arbitrary ordering would not be
allowed, I fully agree that the main swap selection logic would become
simpler than my current implementation.

Then I would like to ask a fundamental question about priority. Priority is
a user interface, and the user has the choice. From the beginning, when the
user sets priorities, there could be a scenario where the slower swap is
given a higher priority and the faster swap is given a lower one. That is
possible. For example, if the faster device has a short lifetime, a real
use case might be to consume the slower swap first for endurance, and only
use the faster swap when unavoidable.

In this case, logically from the LRU perspective there is no inversion of
priority order, but in practice the slower device is filled first. That
looks like degradation from a performance perspective — but it is exactly
what the user intended.

The swap tier concept appears to map priority semantics directly to service
speed, so that higher priority always means faster service. This looks like
it enforces the choice on the user(but it is opend).

Even with swap tiers, under the semantics you suggested, it is possible for
a given cgroup to use only the slower tier. From that cgroup’s view there
is no LRU inversion, but since the fast swap exists and is left unused, it
could still be seen as an "inverse" in terms of usage.

In summary, what I struggle to understand is that if the major assumption
is that swap operation must always align with service speed, then even swap
tiers can contradict it (since users may deliberately prefer the lower
tier). In that case, wouldn’t the whole concept of letting users select swap
devices by priority itself also become a problem?

Option 1 does not really align with the usage scenario I had in mind,
since it starts from the fast swap. Option 2 fits partially, but requires
controlling when to enable the fast tier once full, and handling LRU
movement — which adds complexity.

Your final suggestion of Option 1 seems consistent with your original
objection: that the system design should fundamentally aim at performance
improvement by making use of the fast swap first.

I initially understood vswap could also be treated as an
identity selectable in the unified swap framework. If that were the case, I
thought it would be hard to map vswap into the tier concept. Was that my
misinterpretation?

I agree that from the perspective of implementing the main swap selection
logic, tiers are simpler. Since arbitrary ordering is not allowed, a large
part of the implementation complexity can indeed be reduced.

Once again, thank you for your thoughtful comments and constructive feedback.
