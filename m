This follows the board, then?

In effect, you are saying there are two set of usage models: one in
split and other in lock-step mode. U-Boot support for split mode was
missing and hence was not done yet. The benefit for users is the option
to get an extra processor to do what ever extra stuff they want to do.

Please add this explanation to your patch. In addition, when you say
arm64: dts: ti: k3*: in subject line (implies you are touch soc dtsi)
and when co-related to the U-boot patch[1], it is confusing to know if
you have the same SoC dtsi change yet to be posted where you switch
from ti,cluster-mode = <1> to <0> - I am concerned if downstream board
dts files will have to consume the firmware names differently. This is
the reason to ask for a comprehensive list of patches for the remote
proc. If a downstream device board dts can continue to move to newer
kernel revisions with no mods, you should state so in your commit
message. There is all kinds of side implications with memory carveouts
etc for a new processor that has to be factored in as well.

Btw, [2] sounds like a bug fix.. So follow the stable kernel rules.

I suggest the following:
* SoC dts files - use a common standard for remote proc - lockstep makes
  sense as it is right now
* Modification to board specific dts files - call them out as board
  files specific patches to flip over to split mode - while considering
  the possibilities that users may NOT upgrade kernel and bootloader at
  the same time and the existence of EFI based dtb handover from
  bootloader to kernel - which means, kernel should be able to handle the
  same combinations correctly. Also handle the carveouts correctly for
  the new processors - at least state the strategy - overlays etc.. Come
  to think of it, I think we should fix up the carveout strategy for
  user programmable remote cores first before attempting all this new
  processor additions.
* Split out the fixes patches separately out - no reason to mix it up
  with the rest of the refactoring.
* Fix your commit messages and subject lines to indicate clearly what is
  impacted, rationale, backward compatibility status
