We know no user/kernel api can ever be changed in the future, so how can
we ever accept this?

Great, we can wait for that work to be done, we have no deadlines or
rush here to do it right.  Again, once we add a user/kernel api, we
can't remove it, so let's take the time to get it right.

Don't you always just move the firmware version forward on new updates
to the kernel driver anyway?  How is this different from normal
operation except that the user/kernel api will now be changed in a
non-backwards-compatible way.  What will break when this happens?
