So my name keeps on getting attached to that, but I don't think I was
involved in the LPC conversation when that got decided.

I very much think having a policy/guidance for better names is a good goal.

I just want to make sure it doesn't become a strict policy that lead
folks to make mistaken assumptions about a static solution being
viable in userland (like folks nostalgicly using "eth0" or a fixed
network device name in scripts expecting it to work on a different
system)

That is a fair point.

So again, yeah, I very much support having better guidance on the names.

I think the number of device constraints and device combinations makes
a raw enumeration of things difficult.

This is why the per-device use->heap mapping "glue" seems necessary to me.

And, I do get that this runs into a similar problem with enumerating
and defining "uses" (which boil down to a combination of
devices-in-a-pipeline and access use patterns), but for Andorid it has
so far been manageable.

Personally, I think the best idea I've heard so far to resolve this
from userland was Christian's suggestion that devices expose links to
compatible heaps, and then userland without a use->heap mapping could
for the set of devices they plan to use in a pipeline, figure out the
common heap name and use that to allocate.

However, that pushes the problem down a bit, requiring drivers
(instead of userland) to know what heaps they can work with and what
the names might be (which again, your goal for standardizing the heap
names isn't a bad thing!). Though, this approach also runs into
trouble as it opens a question of: should it only encode strict
constraint satisfaction, or something more subtle, as while something
might work with multiple heaps, its possible it won't be performant
enough unless it picks a specific one on device A or a different one
on device B.  And getting that sort of device-specific details
embedded into a driver isn't great either.

For generic distros, I don't have a good answer here. Historically the
focus has always been on single device usage, so having the driver do
the allocation was fine, and if you were using multiple devices you
could just copy the memory between the driver allocated buffers.  But
as we've moved to disaggregated IP blocks and device pipelines, all
those potential copies wreck performance and power.   I'm not sure
generic distros have the concept of a device pipeline very well
abstracted (obviously mesa and the wayland/X have had to deal with it,
and the video and camera side is dealing with it more and more).
Maybe a more established notion of use -> pipeline/device collections,
is needed as a starting point? Then using Christian's suggestion, one
could at least enumerate  use -> heap that would be functional. And
maybe device makers could then supplement explicit optimized mapping
overrides for their device?

I just think leaving individual applications (or even individual
frameworks like mesa) to embed assumptions about heap names ->
functionality is going to be a problematic approach.
