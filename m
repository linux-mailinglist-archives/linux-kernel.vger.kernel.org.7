Great :)

I personally wouldn't mind a commit that fixes this up, but if you don't
want to do it, let me know then we can make this a good-first-issue.

And the stored `T::RegistrationData` is shared as read-only with the C
side? Yes in that case we want `UnsafePinned<UnsafeCell<>>` (or for the
moment `Opaque`).

Then use `valid`.

Sure, but the bound asserting that it is `Sync` doesn't need to be here,
having it just on the `impl Sync for MiscDeviceRegistration` is good
enough. (though one could argue that people would get an earlier error
if it is already asserted here. I think we should have some general
guidelines here :)

But it is the data of the MiscDevice, no?

Of the two, I'd prefer `RegistrationData`.

If you think that `RegistrationData` is more clear then go with that.
But I honestly don't derive much meaning from that over just `Data`. You
can still of course mention in the docs that this data is stored in the
registration.

But since there is no other way to associate data to a `MiscDevice`, I
think it makes sense to call it `Data`.
