Open-source TF-A only seem to support rates up to 2208 MHz for cpub and
2016 MHz for cpul, see [3]. The opp-2304000000 should probably be
removed from rk3576.dtsi.

All rates starting from 816 MHz are expected to use the PVTPLL, i.e. the
configured osc ring length (by tf-a) and opp voltage (linux) will
regulate the rate. The measured rate can typically also be read from a
PVTPLL grf reg (0x18).

For the GPU clock I have an incoming series that switch to use GPU
PVTPLL instead of a normal PLL, see [4].
