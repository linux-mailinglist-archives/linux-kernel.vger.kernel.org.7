Thank you for your feedback. I agree this isn’t a simple change, and
the current approach might not be optimal. Let’s work together to find
the best solution.

As for the prevalence of 32-bit ARM machines with LPAE, these devices
are still widely used in our product application. The main goal for
enabling DAMON on these devices is to optimize memory usage. During
usage, we identified this optimization point, as well as overflow issues
with bytes* and other reclaim statistics interfaces.

These devices are still in frequent use, and given their large installed
base, they are unlikely to be replaced in the short term.

Thanks again for your insights. I look forward to working together to
find the best solution.
