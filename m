For SOC_IMX35, it should be selected by default.

    config PINCTRL_IMX35
            bool "IMX35 pinctrl driver"
            depends on OF
            depends on SOC_IMX35 || COMPILE_TEST
            default SOC_IMX35

For the IMX8M* SoC's, that is not done, as there is only a common
SOC_IMX8M config entry, which corresponds to multiple pinctrl drivers,
which we probably don't want to select all of by default.

As it is now, to build for let's say i.MX 8M Plus, you have to enable
    SOC_IMX8M
    PINCTRL_IMX8MP
to get a kernel that is likely to boot.

If you enable
    SOC_IMX8M
    PINCTRL
but not
    PINCTRL_IMX8MP
you won't have pinctrl support, and the kernel will probably not work as
expected.

What am I missing?
