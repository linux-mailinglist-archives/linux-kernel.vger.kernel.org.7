Subject: Re: [PATCH] security/commoncap: don't assume "setid" if all ids are identical

I'm looking at this code:

        /* Check for privilege-elevated exec. */
        if (is_setid ||
            (!__is_real(root_uid, new) &&
             (effective ||
              __cap_grew(permitted, ambient, new))))
                bprm->secureexec =3D 1;

If a luser runs a setuid program, then the kernel will set this
bprm->secureexec bit. Indeed, every time this program re-exec's
itself, that bit will consistently be set. Today.

However, with your change, that behavior will change. The first time
the program is exec'd by luser this bit will be set. However, it will
"surprisingly" not occur should the program exec itself again. If you
are unaware of this bit's purpose there is a nice writeup here:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.1/security/LSM.html

See the "bprm_set_creds" paragraph. My concern is that there is an
exploit vector associated with an abuser setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=3D to
something nefarious, and then invoking a setuid program that happens
to re-exec itself for some reason. The first invocation will be as
before, but when the binary re-exec's itself, I am concerned that this
could cause the privileged binary to load an exploit.

This has nothing to do with your interest in NO_NEW_PRIV but more to
do with the legacy behavior changes like this are exposed to.

Cheers

Andrew
