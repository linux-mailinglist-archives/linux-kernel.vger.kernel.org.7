Yes I know, it will need a bit of rework on my side...the problem is
that anyway does not scale at all, even though matching on SoC could be
less cumbersome ... and the reason is that it is fundamentally wrong
to match SCMI Quirks on anything different from the SCMI vendor/subv/impl_ver
since these are fixes/workarounds against quirks that are completely Vendor
and fw-version specific...

...instead now we are considering using compatibles to overcome the fact
that the vendor probably messed (or will mess up) also the side of
the story related to SCMI fw versions management ... "quirking" SCMI stuff
on platform/sku compatibles is basically a quirk against their broken
fw release process...

...moreover this kind of carpet-quirking that hides the issue on any possible
fw version gives ZERO incentives to the aforementioned vendor to fix its
firmware...(or it fw-release process)...

Indeed, cross posting from your other mail thread, as of now we cannot
even be sure if the Vendor has somehow already updated the SCMI-related
firmware NEITHER we can be sure about this in the future since it has not
even confirmed how they are (or they will) be handling the Impl_Version field...

Having said that, I would add that in this specific case (FC quirk) since the
only way to make use of all of this SCMI stuff from the MicroZoft/ACPI world
is having working FCs and, since it's clear that our lovely vendor wont
certainly break this other lovely OS way of working with SCMI, MAYBE it could
be safe to just apply the quirk to this Vendor forever no matter what the
platform or FW version will be in the future...(so not using compats at all)

...but I will be very happy to leave all of these political/phylosophycal
decisions to Sudeep :P

Thanks,
Cristian
