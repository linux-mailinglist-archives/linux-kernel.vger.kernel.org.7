I was just about to reply to Daniel proposing exactly this alternative, it's
equivalent with what I went with in the MiscDeviceRegistration patches for
supporting the device driver use-case [1].

So, I'm perfectly fine with this approach.

This would indeed be an optimization for the special case that we never care
about actually accessing the Revocable, i.e. where we have no need to make the
"read" have minimal overhead.

However, I think we can do even better and, at the same time, avoid this special
case optimization and have everything be the common case with what I already
plan on implementing:

I want that regardless of how many devres callbacks a driver registers by having
Devres wrapped objects around, there's only a *single* synchronize_rcu() call for
all of them.

We can achieve this by having the devres callbacks on driver unbind in two
stages, the first callback flips the Revocable's atomic for for all Devres
objects, then there is a single synchronize_rcu() and then we drop_in_place()
all the Revocable's data for all Devres objects.

As mentioned above I plan on implementing this, but given that it's "just" a
performance optimization for the driver unbind path and given that we're not
very close to a production driver upstream, it haven't had the highest priority
for me to implement so far.
