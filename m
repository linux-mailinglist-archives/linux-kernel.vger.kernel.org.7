Yes, the TCSR clocks are controlled in the TCSR block, but there's no
"TCSR clocks"-IP-block in the memory map, it's just some registers in
the TCSR block.

And technically TCSR_MUTEX isn't a block of its own either, but so far
it's always been a clearly defined region of TCSR, either in the
beginning or end. (Might even be a separate block in the register map on
some older target, iirc)

Compare with GCC, the DeviceTree isn't saying "address X is a clock,
address Y is a reset, address Z is a GDSC...".

The DeviceTree says "at address A we have the Kaanapali GCC IP block",
and we can refer to it from other nodes as a clock controller, a
reset-controller, and a power-domain provider.


Same here, the DeviceTree should say that at 0x01fc0000 there is a
Kaanapali TCSR block, which is a "syscon", a clock controller and a
reset controller.

We don't know which operating system (or other implementation - e.g.
U-boot) will consume this information, and we don't know what frameworks
or driver model is implemented, so we need to describe things without
thinking of a particular driver model.
