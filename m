# Introduction

This patchset aims to introduce an approach to ensure that memory
allocations are forced to be accounted to the memory cgroup, even if
they exceed the cgroup's maximum limit. In such cases, the reclaim
process is postponed until the task returns to the user. This is
beneficial for users who perform over-max reclaim while holding multiple
locks or other resources (especially resources related to file system
writeback). If a task needs any of these resources, it would otherwise
have to wait until the other task completes reclaim and releases the
resources. Postponing reclaim to the return-to-user path helps avoid this issue.

# Background

We have been encountering an hungtask issue for a long time. Specifically,
when a task holds the jbd2 handler and subsequently enters direct reclaim
because it reaches the hard limit within a memory cgroup, the system may become
blocked for a long time. The stack trace of waiting thread holding the jbd2
handle is as follows (and so many other threads are waiting on the same jbd2
handle):

We've obtained a coredump and dumped struct scan_control from it by using crash tool.

struct scan_control {
  nr_to_reclaim = 32,
  order = 0 '\000',
  priority = 1 '\001',
  reclaim_idx = 4 '\004',
  gfp_mask = 17861706, __GFP_NOFAIL
  nr_scanned = 27810, 
  nr_reclaimed = 0,
  nr = {
        dirty = 27797,
        unqueued_dirty = 27797,
        congested = 0,
        writeback = 0,
        immediate = 0,
        file_taken = 27810,
        taken = 27810
  },
}

The ->nr_reclaimed is zero meaning there is no memory we have reclaimed because
most of the file pages are unqueued dirty. And ->priority is 1 also meaning we
spent so much time on memory reclamation. Since this thread has held the jbd2
handler, the jbd2 thread was waiting for the same jbd2 handler, which blocked
so many other threads from writing dirty pages as well.

Furthermore, we observed that memory usage far exceeded the configured memory maximum,
reaching around 38GB.

memory.max  : 134896020    514 GB
memory.usage: 144747169    552 GB

We investigated this issue and identified the root cause:
  try_charge_memcg:
    retry charge
     charge failed
       -> direct reclaim
        -> mem_cgroup_oom    return true，but selected task is in an uninterruptible state
           -> retry charge

In which cases, we saw many tasks in the uninterruptible (D) state with a pending
SIGKILL signal. The OOM killer selects a victim and returns success, allowing the
current thread to retry the memory charge. However, the selected task cannot acknowledge
the SIGKILL signal because it is stuck in an uninterruptible state. As a result,
the charging task resets nr_retries and attempts to reclaim again, but the victim
task never exits. This causes the current thread to enter a prolonged retry loop
during direct reclaim, holding the jbd2 handler for much more time and leading to
system-wide blocking. Why are there so many uninterruptible (D) state tasks?
Check the most common stack trace.

Check the owner of mm_struct.mmap_lock. The task below was entering memory reclaim
holding mmap lock and there are 68 tasks in this memory cgroup, with 23 of them in
the memory reclaim context.

Many threads was entering the memory reclaim in UN state, other threads was blocking
on mmap_lock. Although the OOM killer selects a victim, it cannot terminate it. The
task holding the jbd2 handle retries memory charge, but it fails. Reclaiming continues
while holding the jbd2 handler. write_pages also fails while waiting for the same jbd2
handler, causing repeated shrink failures and potentially leading to a system-wide block.

ps | grep UN | wc -l
1463

While the system has 1463 UN state tasks, so the way to break this akin to "deadlock" is
to let the thread holding jbd2 handler quickly exit the memory reclamation process.

We found that a related issue was reported and partially fixed in previous patches [1][2].
However, those fixes only skip direct reclamation and return a failure for some cases such
as readahead requests. As sb_getblk() is called multiple times in __ext4_get_inode_loc()
with the NOFAIL flag, the problem still exists. And it is not feasible to simply remove
__GFP_RECLAIMABLE when holding jbd2 handle to avoid potential very long memory reclaim
latency,  as __GFP_NOFAIL is not supported without __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM.

# Fundamentals

This patchset introduces a new task flag of PF_MEMALLOC_ACFORCE to indicate that memory
allocations are forced to be accounted to the memory cgroup, even if they exceed the cgroup's
maximum limit. The reclaim process is deferred until the task returns to the user without
holding any kernel resources for memory reclamation, thereby preventing priority inversion
problems. Any users who might encounter potential similar issues can utilize this new flag
to allocate memory and prevent long-term latency for the entire system.
