In the bug report linked below, the kernel identifies itself as:

  6.12.18-android16-1-maybe-dirty-4k #1

... which strongly suggests that (in addition to uncommitted changes),
the kernel is based on the v6.12.18 table kernel, i.e. commit:

  105a31925e2d (tag v6.12.18)

... in the upstream stable tree.

Please note that between v6.12 and v6.12.18 there are 3929 commits, any
of which could be significant to this issue.

As with the other report I replied on:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/aD_zu4GNfOKxXXQk@J2N7QTR9R3/T/#t

... I do not think you are providing accurate details.

Based on the information provided so far, I don't think this is true.
You have not identified the root cause, and you have not demonstrated
that the issue exists in the upstream tag you mention above.

Why do you believe that the root cause lies in the upstream codebase?

It's not clear which kernel specifically you're running, but I'm fairly
confident that it's not built from a recent commit in the android16-6.12
branch.

If the "v6.12.18" prefix in the kernel tree is accurate, then your
kernel is no newer than commit:

  b3fb80bdc64b ("Merge 6.12.19 into android16-6.12")

... in the android16-6.12 branch, and there are 1000+ commits since
then.

This is misleading; ret_from_fork() has nothing to do with this hang.

Is this something you've guessed at yourself, or is this what syzkaller
reported to you?

In the linked bug, the kernel reports:

| INFO: task kworker/2:7:5593 blocked for more than 143 seconds.
|       Tainted: G            E      6.12.18-android16-1-maybe-dirty-4k #1

Note that ret_from_fork() is the assembly stub used to start any kernel
thread. Here it just means that a new kthread was started, and that has
blocked for some reaason in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state.

Whatever it's blocked on is due to code elsewhere.
