code referenced in [4].

I would call it a hardware-defined limit that can be probed by software.

The main question is whether this file returns the exact number of
RMIDs hardware can track or double that number (mbm_total_bytes +
mbm_local_bytes) so that the value is always measured in events.

There's also the mongroup-RMID overcommit use case I described
above[1]. On Intel we can safely assume that there are counters to
back all RMIDs, so num_mbm_cntrs would be calculated directly from
num_rmids.

I realized this use case is more difficult to implement on MPAM,
because a PARTID is effectively a CLOSID+RMID, so deferring assigning
a unique PARTID to a group also results in it being in a different
allocation group. It will work if the unmonitored groups could find a
way to share PARTIDs, but this has consequences on allocation - but
hopefully no worse than sharing CLOSIDs on x86.

There's a lot of interest in monitoring ID overcommit in Google, so I
think it's worth it for me to investigate the additional structural
changes needed in resctrl (i.e., breaking the FS-level association
between mongroups and HW monitoring IDs). Such a framework could be a
better fit for soft-ABMC. For example, if overcommit is allowed, we
would just report the number of simultaneous RMIDs we were able to
probe as num_rmids. I would want the same shared assignment scheduler
to be able to work with RMIDs and counters, though.

Thanks,
-Peter
