On naming, the existing (modern) convention for single-pte helpers is to start
the function name with ptep_. When we started adding batched versions, we took
the approach of adding _ptes as a suffix. For example:

set_pte_at()
ptep_get_and_clear_full()
ptep_set_wrprotect()

set_ptes()
get_and_clear_full_ptes()
wrprotect_ptes()

In this case, we already have ptep_modify_prot_start() and
ptep_modify_prot_commit() for the existing single-pte helper versions. So
according to the convention (or at least how I interpret the convention), the
proposed names seem reasonable.

Yes, but again by convention, that is captured in the kerneldoc comment for the
functions. We are operating on a batch of *ptes* not on a folio or batch of
folios. But it is a requirement of the function that the batch of ptes all lie
within a single large folio (i.e. the pfns are sequential).

Agreed!

For better or worse, that's the established convention. See part of comment for
set_ptes() for example:

"""
 * Context: The caller holds the page table lock.  The pages all belong
 * to the same folio.  The PTEs are all in the same PMD.
"""

This style is copied from get_and_clear_full_ptes(), which has this comment,
which explains all this complexity. My vote would be to have a simple comment
for this function:

/**
 * get_and_clear_full_ptes - Clear present PTEs that map consecutive pages of
 *			     the same folio, collecting dirty/accessed bits.
 * @mm: Address space the pages are mapped into.
 * @addr: Address the first page is mapped at.
 * @ptep: Page table pointer for the first entry.
 * @nr: Number of entries to clear.
 * @full: Whether we are clearing a full mm.
 *
 * May be overridden by the architecture; otherwise, implemented as a simple
 * loop over ptep_get_and_clear_full(), merging dirty/accessed bits into the
 * returned PTE.
 *
 * Note that PTE bits in the PTE range besides the PFN can differ. For example,
 * some PTEs might be write-protected.
 *
 * Context: The caller holds the page table lock.  The PTEs map consecutive
 * pages that belong to the same folio.  The PTEs are all in the same PMD.

I agree it's not pretty to look at. But apparently it's the most efficient. This
is Willy's commit that started it all: Commit bcc6cc832573 ("mm: add default
definition of set_ptes()").

For the record, I think all your comments make good sense, Lorenzo. But there is
an established style, and personally I think at this point is it more confusing
to break from that style.

Thanks,
Ryan
