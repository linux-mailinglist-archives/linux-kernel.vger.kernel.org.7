+Description
+-----------
+
+Real-time applications may have design flaws such that they experience
+unexpected latency and fail to meet their time requirements. Often, these =
flaws
+follow a few patterns:
+
+  - Page faults: A real-time thread may access memory that does not have a
+    mapped physical backing or must first be copied (such as for copy-on-w=
rite).
+    Thus a page fault is raised and the kernel must first perform the expe=
nsive
+    action. This causes significant delays to the real-time thread
+  - Priority inversion: A real-time thread blocks waiting for a lower-prio=
rity
+    thread. This causes the real-time thread to effectively take on the
+    scheduling priority of the lower-priority thread. For example, the rea=
l-time
+    thread needs to access a shared resource that is protected by a
+    non-pi-mutex, but the mutex is currently owned by a non-real-time thre=
ad.
+
+The `rtapp` monitor detects these patterns. It aids developers to identify
+reasons for unexpected latency with real-time applications. It is a contai=
ner of
+multiple sub-monitors described in the following sections.
+
+Monitor pagefault
++++++++++++++++++
+
+The `pagefault` monitor reports real-time tasks raising page faults. Its
+specification is::
+
+  RULE =3D always (RT imply not PAGEFAULT)
+
+To fix warnings reported by this monitor, `mlockall()` or `mlock()` can be=
 used
+to ensure physical backing for memory.
+
+This monitor may have false negatives because the pages used by the real-t=
ime
+threads may just happen to be directly available during testing.  To minim=
ize
+this, the system can be put under memory pressure (e.g.  invoking the OOM =
killer
+using a program that does `ptr =3D malloc(SIZE_OF_RAM); memset(ptr, 0,
+SIZE_OF_RAM);`) so that the kernel executes aggressive strategies to recyc=
le as
+much physical memory as possible.
+
+Monitor sleep
++++++++++++++
+
+The `sleep` monitor reports real-time threads sleeping in a manner that may
+cause undesirable latency. Real-time applications should only put a real-t=
ime
+thread to sleep for one of the following reasons:
+
+  - Cyclic work: real-time thread sleeps waiting for the next cycle. For t=
his
+    case, only the `clock_nanosleep` syscall should be used with `TIMER_AB=
STIME`
+    (to avoid time drift) and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (to avoid the clock being
+    changed). No other method is safe for real-time. For example, threads
+    waiting for timerfd can be woken by softirq which provides no real-time
+    guarantee.
+  - Real-time thread waiting for something to happen (e.g. another thread
+    releasing shared resources, or a completion signal from another thread=
). In
+    this case, only futexes (FUTEX_LOCK_PI, FUTEX_LOCK_PI2 or one of
+    FUTEX_WAIT_*) should be used.  Applications usually do not use futexes
+    directly, but use PI mutexes and PI condition variables which are buil=
t on
+    top of futexes. Be aware that the C library might not implement condit=
ional
+    variables as safe for real-time. As an alternative, the librtpi library
+    exists to provide a conditional variable implementation that is correc=
t for
+    real-time applications in Linux.
+
+Beside the reason for sleeping, the eventual waker should also be
+real-time-safe. Namely, one of:
+
+  - An equal-or-higher-priority thread
+  - Hard interrupt handler
+  - Non-maskable interrupt handler
+
+This monitor's warning usually means one of the following:
+
+  - Real-time thread is blocked by a non-real-time thread (e.g. due to
+    contention on a mutex without priority inheritance). This is priority
+    inversion.
+  - Time-critical work waits for something which is not safe for real-time=
 (e.g.
+    timerfd).
+  - The work executed by the real-time thread does not need to run at real=
-time
+    priority at all.  This is not a problem for the real-time thread itsel=
f, but
+    it is potentially taking the CPU away from other important real-time w=
ork.
+
+Application developers may purposely choose to have their real-time applic=
ation
+sleep in a way that is not safe for real-time. It is debatable whether tha=
t is a
+problem. Application developers must analyze the warnings to make a proper
+assessment.
+
+The monitor's specification is::
+
+  RULE =3D always ((RT and SLEEP) imply (RT_FRIENDLY_SLEEP or ALLOWLIST))
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_SLEEP =3D (RT_VALID_SLEEP_REASON or KERNEL_THREAD)
+                  and ((not WAKE) until RT_FRIENDLY_WAKE)
+
+  RT_VALID_SLEEP_REASON =3D FUTEX_WAIT
+                       or RT_FRIENDLY_NANOSLEEP
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_NANOSLEEP =3D CLOCK_NANOSLEEP
+                      and NANOSLEEP_TIMER_ABSTIME
+                      and NANOSLEEP_CLOCK_MONOTONIC
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_WAKE =3D WOKEN_BY_EQUAL_OR_HIGHER_PRIO
+                  or WOKEN_BY_HARDIRQ
+                  or WOKEN_BY_NMI
+                  or KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP
+
+  ALLOWLIST =3D BLOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX
+           or FUTEX_LOCK_PI
+           or TASK_IS_RCU
+           or TASK_IS_MIGRATION
+
+Beside the scenarios described above, this specification also handle some
+special cases:
+
+  - `KERNEL_THREAD`: kernel tasks do not have any pattern that can be reco=
gnized
+    as valid real-time sleeping reasons. Therefore sleeping reason is not
+    checked for kernel tasks.
+  - `KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP`: a non-real-time thread may stop a real-time ker=
nel
+    thread by waking it and waiting for it to exit (`kthread_stop()`). This
+    wakeup is safe for real-time.
+  - `ALLOWLIST`: to handle known false positives with the kernel.
+  - `BLOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX` is included in the allowlist due to its implementa=
tion.
+    In the release path of rt_mutex, a boosted task is de-boosted before w=
aking
+    the rt_mutex's waiter. Consequently, the monitor may see a real-time-u=
nsafe
+    wakeup (e.g. non-real-time task waking real-time task). This is actual=
ly
+    real-time-safe because preemption is disabled for the duration.
+  - `FUTEX_LOCK_PI` is included in the allowlist for the same reason as
+    `BLOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX`.
