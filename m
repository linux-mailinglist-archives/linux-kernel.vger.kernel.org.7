Hmm, does try_to_unmap_flush() actually need to ensure that *all* pending TLBIs
are completed, or does it only need to ensure that the TLBIs previously issued
by the same instance of shrink_folio_list() are completed?

I understood it to be the latter and therefore thought the current
arch_tlbbatch_flush() was safe.

If another instance has concurrently queued up some TLBIs using tlbbatch (i.e.
MADV_PAGEOUT) then the first instance would never see those PTEs so I don't
think it matters that the TLB flush is still pending? Perhaps I'm wrong...

My initial instinct is yuk :). I guess we would need to do a bunch of
benchmarking if this is needed. But would be good to avoid if possible. Let's
figure out if we definitely have a race first...

No worries, it happens.
