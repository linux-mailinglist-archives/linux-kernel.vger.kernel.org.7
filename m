Thank you for the feedback.  In my humble opinion, nevertheless, this is what
the fourth patch of this series is aiming to provide.  And thanks to your
comment, I now realize I forgot mentioning this on the above comment.

Of course we can add execution commands and output example here, but without
understanding of the metrics, it would just look like mysterious numbers.
Meanhile, user interface of the module is simply module parameters that should
be familiar to most kernel users, so I don't think it necessarily deserves
example commands.

I agree this cover letter is not enough for getting clear idea of how readers
can use this feature.  Thank you for letting me realize this.  But I think this
cover letter might be better to keep the brevity, as long as it points where
readers can get necessary details.  What do you think about revising this cover
letter to

1. point the fourth patch for usage of DAMON_STAT, and
2. elaborate the fact that readers are recommended to read the metric
   definitions and usages to get more clear idea of DAMON_STAT?


Thanks,
SJ
