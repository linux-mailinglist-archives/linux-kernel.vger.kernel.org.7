The part that is not straightforward is that the primary purpose of
`T` may not be "to be exposed via DebugFS", and leaves us in the
unusual world where DebugFS (or at least our bindings to it) are
load-bearing in builds that have DebugFS disabled. It can work, but it
definitely seems confusing and is privileging DebugFS holding a
reference to a data structure over other things holding a reference to
it.

I have a version of this that works with my initial driver, and keep
intending to revise it to work on top of the new one, but I keep
getting requests for API changes before I get around to reworking it
;)

The way I intended my `ForeignOwnable` variant of this to work was
that I would have a *single* struct that contained all the scanned
data. For the socinfo module, we know how big this could be, so we
could put this as a `static` in the module, in which case we'd have
`&'static MyInfo`. If we didn't want to do that or didn't know, we'd
produce an `Arc<MyInfo>`. Then, for each file, we'd create a file that
passed in either `my_arc_info.clone()` or `my_info` if we had the
static reference, with the functions that do the printing
distinguishing the behavior of each file.

Doing the file-owns-the-specific-field version *could* work, but means
that the debugfs tree code would be interleaved with the calls to
parsing code, or that we'd need two copies of the struct, an initial
one with all the parsed data, and a follow-up one that has has them
all wrapped in `File`.

If `Firmware` outliving the GPU instance causes a bug, not just a
resource leak, I'd argue that you should be passing a narrower handle
to your debugfs file. If it just causes a resource leak, then I'd
argue that if you leak a resource (the debugfs file itself), then
leaking a resource is not unexpected.

For the narrower handle example, consider e.g.
```
struct Firmware {
  info: Arc<FirmwareInfo>,
  my_handle: Handle // Some handle whose drop is load bearing
}
// ...
let fw: Firmware =3D build_fw()?;
let fw_file =3D fw.info.clone();
fw.do_something();

This seems odd to me because with this model the DebugFS file itself
becomes deeply involved with the ownership of the devices or other
data. There are a few issues I think this creates:
1. It discourages file-per-field, because you can no longer have the
DebugFS file uniquely own something, which you're now trying to
encourage. This seems likely to result in people having debugfs files
that render out structured data, which I think we generally don't
want?
2. If I have a module and want to add a new DebugFS file to it, the
change will edit the core structures of the drivers rather than just
adding an auxiliary field. This is partially remedied if we make
`File<D>` implement `Deref<Target=3DD>`. It will still either incur
churn or imprecision around commonly derived traits like equality and
debug. If I have `#[derive(PartialEq)]` on my struct including
`DeviceData`, and then I wrap that into a `File<DeviceData>`, we'll
get stuck with a quandry:
  a. Should files `x =3D=3D y` if the underlying private data is equal?
This has the benefit of preserving the behavior of the derive, but
means that distinct files may compare equal if they have the same
contents.
  b. Should files `x =3D=3D y` only be true if the underlying *file* is
the same? This seems logical for *file* equality, but will break
equality on the field or structures including it.
  This will also be an incompatible change for anyone already using an
explicit `.deref()` or an explicit `impl Deref<Target =3D T>` method to
work with the field, because while deref coercion will automatically
chain, `impl Deref<Target =3D T>` *cannot* automatically chain.
3. If you create an object specifically for debugging, then it will
*have* to be created and kept around even if DebugFS is disabled,
because we can't tell whether the user is relying on its existence.
(My current implementation keeps it around in that case as well, but
that's not guaranteed or required - we could cause it to just
immediately drop data that someone tried to attach.) This means that
rather than relying on the API to determine whether the information is
needed, the modules will need to check the config if they want to get
rid of it.

Nit: This can't work, because a `&[u8]` is double-width, and we only
get to send one pointer into the file. We'd need to add a requirement
`T: Sized` if we really wanted to have `File` embed the data.

If we implement *only* pinned files, we run into an additional problem
- you can't easily extend a pinned vector. This means that you cannot
have dynamically created devices unless you're willing to put every
new `File` into its own `Box`, because you aren't allowed to move any
of the previously allocated `File`s for a resize.

Where previously you would have had

```
debug_files: Vec<File>
```

you would now have

```
debug_files: Vec<PinBox<File<T>>>
```

If it's easy to use the model you described earlier where the sole
owner of the data is the debugfs file, then this is mostly fine,
because to use the old version, you'd already have it live in a
`ForeignOwnable`, which most likely means its own allocation. However,
if you're already forced into an environment where the objects you're
embedding into a file are reference counted, you now have an extra
allocation required for every `File`. Because the `File` has to be
able to respond to `data()`, we also won't have these `File`s truncate
to zero size in the no debugfs scenario.

This means that if you want a `File` to render an object that is
reference counted, and they're dynamically created and destroyed, you
will now be required to incur an allocation per file, even when
DebugFS is disabled.
