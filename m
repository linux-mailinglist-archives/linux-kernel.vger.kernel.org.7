Thanks for the background here.

The hardware configuration in DT should be consumed by OP-TEE and the
kernel probes remoteproc properties from OP-TEE since it's an OP-TEE
mediated remoteproc service you are adding here.

As I mentioned below, this should be achievable using the secure-status
property without introducing the new compatible:

Kernel managed remoteproc:
   status = "okay"; secure-status = "disabled";     /* NS-only */

OP-TEE managed remoteproc:
   status = "disabled"; secure-status = "okay";     /* S-only */

Making the TEE based remoteproc service independent of DT will surely
make it more scalable to other platforms too. Have a look at how OP-TEE
based HWRNG service scales across platforms.

No, it's not a DT ABI break at all. It is always possible for a
hardware to be re-configured to change assignment of peripherals among
OP-TEE and Linux kernel.

This is mostly meant for peripherals that can be probed by both OP-TEE
and Linux kernel via DT. But here in case of remoteproc, there needs to
exclusive access control for either via Linux kernel or OP-TEE. Hence, the
"status" and "secure-status" properties should be updated accordingly.

Okay I see, so you can add unique proc ID to DT which gets consumed by
OP-TEE and Linux discovers the same via the TEE service.

Sure, so they can also be discovered by TEE service.
