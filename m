Correct, those added tests do not enforce that one cannot register a static
minor above MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR.

However, to some extent [1], it tests that a MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR allocation
will not return a number in the range of the static numbers. See
miscdev_test_dynamic_only_range.

It also tests that if a dynamic minor is allocated and one tries to
allocate that same number statically, it will fail. It also tries [2] to
test the other way around. That is, if one minor was statically allocate in
the dynamic range, that a dynamic allocation will not return that same
number.

Those tests, named miscdev_test_conflict and miscdev_test_conflict_reverse
were written considering the current implementation, which allows for
static allocations in the "dynamic range".

If we are going to change that, you need to change the tests too.

I would suggest applying only the last hunk of your patched
drivers/char/misc.c with a separate commit. Then, when misc_deregister
would be called the minor would be restored. However, since statically
allocating a minor above 255 would still be allowed, it could "restore" it
wrongly.

As Greg has observed, if there is no known case in the kernel where minor
is not set to MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR by the driver before it calls
misc_register a second time, then there is nothing to fix here. If there
is such a case, then the driver must be fixed. It has always been the case,
even when the ranges were different, that the minor needed to be reset to
MISC_DYNAMIC_MINOR before calling misc_register after misc_deregister has
been called.

As you point out, when misc_register fails, it already restores the minor
number.

Let me know if you want to proceed with this change and need help with the
test case. I may be slow to respond since I am going on vacation.

Regards.
Cascardo.


[1] To some extent, because due to the large dynamic range, it only tries
allocating 256 dynamic minors. And only verifies numbers below 16 are not
returned, because that was the bug that existed before.

[2] Tries, because due to the large dynamic range, instead of allocating
all numbers, it just assumes that the allocator would give the first
number, but it also picks that "first" number by doing a dynamic allocation
and freeing it.
