I'd say it's cleaner and we already have some APIs that utilize type
states, so I'd prefer we use that where it makes sense.

I'd fold it into the previous bullet point. To me they aren't really
disjoint.

I don't see the point in stating it in two separate bullet points.

I see two different options on what to do about the leak:

(1) implement `disable` in terms of a new function `try_disable`
    returning `Result<Regulator, DisableError>` where `DisableError`
    gives access to the `EnabledRegulator`.

(2) document that the `disable` function leaks the refcount if an error
    is returned.

I have a slight preference for (1), but if Mark & you decide that it's
not necessary, since users of regulators won't need it any time soon,
then go with (2).

It's pretty common in Rust to have a custom error type for those cases.
I think we should also do it here, Alice already used the pattern in the
alloc module [1].

Ah I overlooked that. Then it's fine.
