Who said anything about it being a requirement?  I think we have gone
way off track here.

Certainly it would be *nice* to have all of that stuff documented, and I
think there is value in giving a visual clue for stuff that lacks
documentation, but I never said anything about requirements.

Because you're thinking in terms of the rendered docs, and not the
people who read the plain text.  "function()" is far more readable than
":c:func:`!function()`", don't you agree?  And rather easier to write as
well.

The cross-referencing is *to* the API documentation.  Again, you are
mentioning a function, why would you *not* want to let the system
automatically link to that function's documentation?  Especially since
you're using markup that is explicitly provided for exactly that
purpose?  Does the link cause some sort of harm?

Thanks,
