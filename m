For what it is, most of it comes from:

1. "tpm: use a map for tpm2_calc_ordinal_duration()"
    Flattened out timeout calculations to a table and increase timeout
    for TPM2_SelfTest, which addresses longer timeout on Raspeberry Pi.
2. "tpm: Prevent local DOS via tpm/tpm0/ppi/*operations"
   Caches TPM physical presence interface ACPI functions on first run
   instead of requesting for every read.

Also:

1. I went through Chris' email because you asked to refer to it.
2. I also spent time re-testing O_EXCL change throughly once more. From
   my subjective perspective I was exactly trying to address other people's
   concerns.

That said, I fell off the track and yeah not well delivered agreed.

Maybe I had a bad choice of words but there's no configuration that
breaks with anything sold as discrete TPM chips, embedded SoC, fTPM's
or anything really. I got the impression of a bug in the wild, other
than the perf regression.

I deeply care anything that can be bought with money or even anything
that drifts away from a spec manageable amount.

Very true :-)
