Yes, that makes sense. Perhaps we can also simplify it further:

# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/mbm_assign_mode:
[mbm_cntr_evt_assign] <- for ABMC
 mbm_cntr_grp_assign  <- for soft-ABMC

Sure. The option A: fits well here then.

 Option A (counters are RMIDs):
 # cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
 0=31;1=31
