Thanks for doing this!

I have a few comments, most of which are just nits.  I think we should
be able to get this in for 6.17.

We don't really need the above in the changelog - just say what you're
doing.

I wonder if this should be made just a bit stronger, given that linked
lists are positively out of favor for situations where cache behavior
matters.

Better to just say "struct list_head", and the automarkup logic should
take care of the rest.

Here too - just container_of().  I note we don't have documentation for
that macro, which seems like a big oversight.

I do wonder if you should start by showing the list_head structure
itself?  It is simple enough and not a secret that needs to be kept.

You don't say what list_entry() is actually doing - that seems worth a
sentence.

There comes a point, I think, where the (very nice) diagrams speak for
themselves; I'm not entirely sure it needs to be spelled out in this
much detail.  By this point, I would expect readers to be just skipping
over these descriptions.

I do still think you should move the kerneldoc for lists over from
kernel-api.rst; just tack it onto the end here.
