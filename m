This means users are required to manipulate two interfaces.  DAMON sysfs for
target nodes, and weighted_interleave sysfs for weights.  I don't think this
coupling is very ideal.

Off the opt of my head, I concern if users could mistakenly forget updating one
of those, since the requirement is not very clear.  I think the interface
should clearly explain that.  For example, writing a special keywords, say,
"use_interleave_weights" to target_nid parameter sysfs file.  But, even in the
case, users who update weighted_interleave might foget updating target nodes on
DAMON interface.

I think letting DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} to use all nodes as migration target
when the special keyword is given is one of better options.  This is what I
suggested to the previous version of this patch series.  But now I think it
would be better if we could just remove this coupling.

I understand a sort of this coupling is inevitable if the kernel should make
the connection between DAMON and weighted interleaving itself, without
user-space help.  But now I think we could get user-space help, according to
below.  Please keep reading.

So, at least in this toy example, we have user-space control.  Then, I think we
could decouple DAMON and weighted interleaving, and ask the usr-space tool to
be the connection between those.  That is, extend DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} to
let users specify migration target nodes and their weights.  And ask the
user-space tool to periodically read weighted interleaving parameters that
could be auto-tuned, and update DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} parameters
accordingly.  Actually the user-space tool on this example is making the
weights by itself, so this should be easy work to do?

Also, even for general use case, I think such user-space intervention is not
too much request.  Please let me know if I'm wrong.

These make perfect sense to me.  Thank you for adding this great summary.

Awesome.  Thank you for conducting this great tests and sharing the results!

I'm happy with it for RFC level implementation.  And in my opinion, you now
proved this is a good idea.  For next steps toward mainline landing, I'd like
to suggest below interface change.

Let's allow users specify DAMOS_MIGRATE_{HOT,COLD} target nodes and weights
using only DAMON interface.  And let the user-space tool do the synchronization
with weighted interleaving or other required works.

This may require writing not small amount of code, especially for DAMON sysfs
interface.  I think it is doable, though.  If you don't mind, I'd like to
quickly make a prototype and share with you.

What do you think?

I have no opinion, and would like to let mempolicy folks make voices.  But if
we go on the decoupling approach as I suggested above, we can do this
discussion in a separate thread :)

Again, thank you for revisioning.  Please bear in mind with me at next steps.
I believe this work is very promising.


Thanks,
