The thing is, that's exactly what we're doing. ext4 and bcachefs both
refer to a specific revision of the folding rules: for ext4 it's
specified in the superblock, for bcachefs it's hardcoded for the moment.

I don't think this is the ideal approach, though.

That means the folding rules are "whatever you got when you mkfs'd".
Think about what that means if you've got a fleet of machines, of
different ages, but all updated in sync: that's a really annoying way
for gremlins of the "why does this machine act differently" variety to
creep in.

What I'd prefer is for the unicode folding rules to be transparently and
automatically updated when the kernel is updated, so that behaviour
stays in sync. That would behave more the way users would expect.

But I only gave this real thought just over the past few days, and doing
this safely and correctly would require some fairly significant changes
to the way casefolding works.

We'd have to ensure that lookups via the case sensitive name always
works, even if the casefolding table the dirent was created with give
different results that the currently active casefolding table.

That would require storing two different "dirents" for each real dirent,
one normalized and one un-normalized, because we'd have to do an
un-normalized lookup if the normalized lookup fails (and vice versa).
Which should be completely fine from a performance POV, assuming we have
working negative dentries.

But, if the unicode folding rules are stable enough (and one would hope
they are), hopefully all this is a non-issue.

I'd have to gather more input from users of casefolding on other
filesystems before saying what our long term plans (if any) will be.
