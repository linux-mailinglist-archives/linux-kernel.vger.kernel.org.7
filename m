Hi Mitchell,

Thank you very much for both testing and sharing the results! I'm glad
no major regressions were noted, and in some cases performance was
marginally better. Another good set of workloads to test for defer
would be latency tests... THP=3Dalways can increase PF latencies, while
"defer" should eliminate that penalty, with the hopes of regaining
some of the THP benefits after the khugepaged collapse.

I wanted to note one thing, with the default of max_ptes_none=3D511 and
no mTHP sizes configured, the khugepaged series' (both mine and Devs)
should have very little impact. This is a good test of the defer
feature, while confirming that neither me nor Dev regressed the legacy
PMD khugepaged case; however, this is not a good test of the actual
mTHP collapsing.

If you plan on testing the mTHP changes for performance changes, I
would suggest enabling all the mTHP orders and setting max_ptes_none=3D0
(Devs series requires 0 or 511 for mTHP collapse to work). Given this
is a new feature, it may be hard to find something to compare it to,
other than each other's series'. enabling defer during these tests has
the added benefit of pushing everything to khugepaged and really
stressing its mTHP collapse performance.

Once again thank you for taking the time to test these features :)
