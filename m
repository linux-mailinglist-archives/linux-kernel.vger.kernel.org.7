Hi,

Yes. Dell XPS 9345 is arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/x1e80100.dtsi based,
and Asus Zenbook A14 is arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/x1p42100.dtsi based,
which is a derivative but has a slightly different PCIe setup. So far
both laptops would behave in the same ways.

Just tested, and it appears to solve it, though I see some errors on
wakeup that I don't remember seeing before. I will test-drive this
setup for a day to provide better feedback and confirm if it is
related to the fixup or not.

I will share the logs with and without the fixup by private email
attachment in a bit.

Thanks for looking into this,
Alex
