Yup, we really pretty much created a micro-benchmark for grabbing stack
traces.

Yes, preempt_disable() is extremely cheap.

What does seem to help is to simply disable lockdep inside dump_trace.
That should be good enough for us at least, bringing the overhead down
to a manageable amount when running these tests.
Some unscientific numbers:

config                               dump_trace     locking
----
no locking (preempt_disable)            6 %         -
guard(rcu)() + lockdep_off             15 %         58 % of that
rcu_read_lock + lockdep_off            17 %         60 % of that
guard(rcu)()                           48 %         91 % of that

That confirms that guard(rcu)() really is not a problem. There might be
slight overhead, but it is probably within the margin of error. Turning
lockdep off/on inside the UML dump_trace() function brings down the
overhead a lot and I guess that should be an acceptable level for us.

Not sure if something like that would be desirable upstream. This is
happening for us when running the hostap "hwsim" tests inside UML (with
time-travel). At least internally, we could carry a custom patch to add
the lockdep_off()/lockdep_on() to dump_trace in order to work around
it[1].

Benjamin

[1] Actually, now I am reminded that we already have that for kmemleak
as lockdep was considerably slowing down the scanning.
