"Misleading" is a concern; the show_mem report would want to print very
explicitly which information is specifically for the memcg and which is
global, and we don't do that now.

I don't think that means we shouldn't print it at all though, because it
can happen that we're in an OOM because one specific codepath is
allocating way more memory than we should be; even if the memory
allocation profiling info isn't correct for the memcg it'll be useful
information in a situation like that, it just needs to very clearly
state what it's reporting on.

I'm not sure we do that very well at all now, I'm looking at
__show_mem() ad it's not even passed a memcg. !?

Also, if anyone's thinking about "what if memory allocation profiling
was memcg aware" - the thing we saw when doing performance testing is
that memcg accounting was much higher overhead than memory allocation
profiling - hence, most kernel memory allocations don't even get memcg
accounting.

I think that got the memcg people looking at ways to make the accounting
cheaper, but I'm not sure if anything landed from that.
