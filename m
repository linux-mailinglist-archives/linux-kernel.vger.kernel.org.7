I started this subthread not for batch migration but the long term goal.  I
took only a glance on the migration batching part, and I'm still trying to find
time to take more deep look on batch migration.

Nonetheless, yes, basically I believe DAMON and Bharata's works have great
opportunities to collaborate and use each other in a very productive ways.  I'm
especially very intersted in kpromoted's AMD IBS code, and trying to make DAMON
easier to be used for Bharata's works.

For batch migration interface, though, to be honest I don't find very clear
DAMON's usage of it, since DAMON does region-based sort of batched migration.
Again, I took only a glance on migration batching part and gonna take more time
to the details.

Meanwhile, if you saw some opportunities, and if you don't mind, it would be
very helpful if you can share your detailed view of the opportunity (how DAMON
could be better by using the migration batching in what way?).


Thanks,
SJ
