Just curious - pmd_pfn() would have otherwise worked on leaf PMD entries ?
Because the PMD swap entries are not leaf entries as pmd_present() returns
negative, pmd_pfn() does not work on those ?

But is not the pmd_pfn() called on pmd which is derived from the swap entry
first.

	pmd = pfn_pmd(args->fixed_pmd_pfn, args->page_prot);
	swp = __pmd_to_swp_entry(pmd);
	pmd = __swp_entry_to_pmd(swp);
	WARN_ON(args->fixed_pmd_pfn != pmd_pfn(pmd));

Hmm, basically it just tests pfn_pmd() and pmd_pfn() conversions ?

Agreed, that will make sense as well.

Alright.

A quick ran on arm64 looks just fine, will keep looking into this.
