Generally you want to assume that the VM is hostile and run QEMU with
as few privileges as possible (not just capabilities, but also in
separate namespaces and with restrictions from device cgroups,
SELinux, etc.). PCI passthrough is not an issue, it only needs access
to the VFIO inodes and you can do it by setting the appropriate file
permissions without extra capabilities. The actual privileged part is
binding the device to VFIO, which is done outside QEMU anyway.

Yes, that's correct. The code for PRIN/PROUT calls out to a separate
privileged process (in scsi/qemu-pr-helper.c if you're curious) which
is aware of multipath and can be extended if needed.

Yes, but once you have CAP_SYS_RAWIO all bets for sanity are off... it
even lets you do SG_IO on partitions.

As long as one path replies to a TUR and the host is able to
(eventually, somehow) steer I/O transparently to that path, that
should be good enough. If the one path that the kernel tries is down,
QEMU can probe which paths are up and retry. That seems consistent
with what you want from TUR but maybe I'm missing something.

I agree (it helps, it doesn't solve the problem), however there is a
large overlap between the two.
