Thank you for your insights about high tail latencies. However, the spikes
I'm encountering in the project related to kworker still stem from RT
processes preempting kworker threads that are already executing. In our
project, I have already implemented my optimization approach by queuing
work to CPU0, since there aren't as many long-running real-time tasks on CPU0.
Moreover, some logic on CPU0 replies on the tty uart data, which provides a
degree of complementarity from the perspective of CPU resource usage. From
the experimental data results, the most significant optimization effect comes
from queuing work to this fixed CPU0, rather than using the WQ_HIGHPRI flag,
although WQ_HIGHPRI does provide some improvement.
I also agree that tasks requiring continuous real-time execution should be
handled by kthread workers. However, while the ideal situation is appealing,
the reality is challenging. A large amount of driver code in the system uses
the system's pwq and worker_pool management, as this API is very convenient.
Refactoring the code carries significant change risks, and even with a team
effort, it's hard to bear such risks.
Adding flags like WQ_HIGHPRI or even introducing WQ_RT from a functional
development perspective doesn't pose too much concern; we just need to focus
on whether there is any impact on performance. In other words, for developers
working on the tty driver in this context, it might be difficult to practically
accept changes to a large portion of the current work code in tty, making
implementation quite challenging.
