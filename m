I am against increasing the size of struct zswap_entry. On x86_64, there
is a 3 byte hole after 'referenced'. We can technically use that,
although the node id is usually an int, which is 4 bytes on x86_64.

In practice, I think 2 bytes (i.e. short) should be enough, but it will
be ugly to cast the node id to a short. We should at least WARN on
overflow.

Or we can take the simple route and drop the bulk allocation.
