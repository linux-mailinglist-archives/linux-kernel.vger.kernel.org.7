I fully agree with all of your suggestions.

I suggested a save/restore cycle primarily because I wasn't 100% 
certain that IRQs were always enabled in that call chain, and a 
superfluous save is better than an unintended IRQ-enable. So it was a 
chicken-bit. :-/

Your title suggestion is also much better, it makes it clear that this 
is not a potential deadlock.

Wording matters.

Thanks,

	Ingo
