Thanks for taking such a scientific approach to this. Most developers
try values until it works, and call it done. It is nice to see
somebody doing some real study.

Russell quoted the standard, which says the delay needs to be between
1ns and 2.6ns, which is quite a wide range. So for a tx_delay value of
0x40, nominally 2000ps, your two values are within that range, and so
conform to the standard.

I can understand that. But there is another way to look at this. I am
making a big jump from just two boards, but it seems to me, tx_delay
and rx_delay are pointless, if they produce such a wide range of
values from what should be identical boards. They cannot be used for
fine tuning because the same value has a 387ps difference, which is
huge compared to the 31ps step.

It seems to me, rx_delay and tx_delay should be deprecated, set to 0,
and let the PHY do they delays. If i remember correctly, that is what
you ended up with for you board?
