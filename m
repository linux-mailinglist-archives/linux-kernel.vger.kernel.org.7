Thanks Suren, yes, as already mentioned by Usama, Meta will be
interested in memcg aware allocation profiling. I would say start simple
and as little overhead as possible. More functionality can be added
later when the need arises. Maybe the first useful addition is just
adding how many allocations for a specific allocation site are memcg
charged.
