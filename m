The main target of this change is the implementation of UFFD for 
KVM/guest_memfd (examples: [1], [2]) to avoid bringing KVM-specific code 
into the mm codebase.  We usually mean KVM by the "drivers" in this 
context, and it is already somewhat "knowledgeable" of the mm.  I don't 
think there are existing use cases for other drivers to implement this 
at the moment.

Although I can't see new exports in this series, there is now a way to 
limit exports to particular modules [3].  Would it help if we only do it 
for KVM initially (if/when actually needed)?
