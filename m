I'm looking into a use case involving drm_panel_follower, which requires
a drm_panel. I don't really need any of the other stuff in drm_panel.

And basically you'd have one drm_panel per connector that is connected
to a panel, within the same driver.

:)

The problem with that is that it forces a certain type of allocation of
drm_panel. devm_drm_panel_alloc() allows embedding drm_panel inside
another struct, but that's inflexible for our use case, where we'd
probably like to embed it inside something that's already allocated as
part of something else.

I mean devm_drm_panel_alloc() is great, but please don't make its use
mandatory!

Nothing upstream is broken per se, but if you allocated drm_panel
directly yourself, initialized it with drm_panel_init(), its refcount
would initially be 0, not 1, and each subsequent get/put on it would
call __drm_panel_free().

Even that doesn't break stuff, because by luck panel->container is also
NULL in this case.
