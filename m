Fair enough -- I think we should properly document those limitations, recommend
using keep() for those cases and ensure that we can't call keep() on the "root"
directory then.

Unless, we can find a better solution, which, unfortunately, I can't think of
one. The only thing I can think of is to reference count (parent) directories,
which would be contrary to how the C API works and not desirable.

If it changes dynamically then it's pretty likely that we do not only want to
add entries dynamically, but also remove them, which implies that we need to be
able to drop them. So, I don't think that's a problem.

What I see more likely to happen is a situation where the "root" directory
(almost) lives forever, and hence subsequent calls, such as

	root.subdir("foo").keep()

effectively are leaks.

One specific example for that would be usb_debug_root, which is created in the
module scope of usb-common and is used by USB host / gadget / phy drivers.

The same is true for other cases where the debugfs "root" is created in the
module scope, but subsequent entries are created by driver instances. If a
driver would use keep() in such a case, we'd effectively leak memory everytime a
device is unplugged (or unbound in general).
