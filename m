Let's then maybe reduce the score of this heuristic and remove intra-doc 
links and titles detection. After reviewing, it indeed doesn't really 
make sense.

As mentioned earlier, we can reduce the score of any heuristic which 
could lead to any important false positive.
In my opinion, as long as the heuristic is relevant, we always have the 
possibility to diminish the score associated with the heuristic, hence 
preventing unnecessary false positives.

I think that you are definitely more experienced with what's done 
commonly in rust code. Let's maybe change this heuristic definition with 
@ related to types or some other annotation. Do you have some example I 
could have a look to come in the next version with a relevant list of @  
we can encounter.

I think it is a nice approach due to the granularity it offers. This 
will drastically reduce the number of false positives.
