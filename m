+Description
+-----------
+
+Real-time applications may have design flaws such that they experience une=
xpected latency and fail
+to meet their time requirements. Often, these flaws follow a few patterns:
+
+  - Page faults: A real-time thread may access memory that does not have a=
 mapped physical backing
+    or must first be copied (such as for copy-on-write). Thus a page fault=
 is raised and the kernel
+    must first perform the expensive action. This causes significant delay=
s to the real-time thread
+  - Priority inversion: A real-time thread blocks waiting for a lower-prio=
rity thread. This causes
+    the real-time thread to effectively take on the scheduling priority of=
 the lower-priority
+    thread. For example, the real-time thread needs to access a shared res=
ource that is protected by
+    a non-pi-mutex, but the mutex is currently owned by a non-real-time th=
read.
+
+The `rtapp` monitor detects these patterns. It aids developers to identify=
 reasons for unexpected
+latency with real-time applications. It is a container of multiple sub-mon=
itors described in the
+following sections.
+
+Monitor pagefault
++++++++++++++++++
+
+The `pagefault` monitor reports real-time tasks raising page faults. Its s=
pecification is::
+
+  RULE =3D always (RT imply not PAGEFAULT)
+
+To fix warnings reported by this monitor, `mlockall()` or `mlock()` can be=
 used to ensure physical
+backing for memory.
+
+This monitor may have false negatives because the pages used by the real-t=
ime threads may just
+happen to be directly available during testing. To minimize this, the syst=
em can be put under memory
+pressure (e.g. invoking the OOM killer using a program that does `ptr =3D =
malloc(SIZE_OF_RAM);
+memset(ptr, 0, SIZE_OF_RAM);`) so that the kernel executes aggressive stra=
tegies to recycle as much
+physical memory as possible.
+
+Monitor sleep
++++++++++++++
+
+The `sleep` monitor reports real-time threads sleeping in a manner that ma=
y cause undesirable
+latency. Real-time applications should only put a real-time thread to slee=
p for one of the following
+reasons:
+
+  - Cyclic work: real-time thread sleeps waiting for the next cycle. For t=
his case, only the
+    `clock_nanosleep` syscall should be used with `TIMER_ABSTIME` (to avoi=
d time drift) and
+    `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (to avoid the clock being changed). No other method =
is safe for real-time. For
+    example, threads waiting for timerfd can be woken by softirq which pro=
vides no real-time
+    guarantee.
+  - Real-time thread waiting for something to happen (e.g. another thread =
releasing shared
+    resources, or a completion signal from another thread). In this case, =
only futexes with priority
+    inheritance (FUTEX_LOCK_PI, FUTEX_LOCK_PI2 or FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI) s=
hould be used.
+    Applications usually do not use futexes directly, but use PI mutexes a=
nd PI condition variables
+    which are built on top of futexes. Be aware that the C library might n=
ot implement conditional
+    variables as safe for real-time. As an alternative, the librtpi librar=
y exists to provide a
+    conditional variable implementation that is correct for real-time appl=
ications in Linux.
+
+Beside the reason for sleeping, the eventual waker should also be real-tim=
e-safe. Namely, one of:
+
+  - An equal-or-higher-priority thread
+  - Hard interrupt handler
+  - Non-maskable interrupt handler
+
+This monitor's warning usually means one of the following:
+
+  - Real-time thread is blocked by a non-real-time thread (e.g. due to con=
tention on a mutex without
+    priority inheritance). This is priority inversion.
+  - Time-critical work waits for something which is not safe for real-time=
 (e.g. timerfd).
+  - The work executed by the real-time thread does not need to run at real=
-time priority at all.
+    This is not a problem for the real-time thread itself, but it is poten=
tially taking the CPU away
+    from other important real-time work.
+
+Application developers may purposely choose to have their real-time applic=
ation sleep in a way that
+is not safe for real-time. It is debatable whether that is a problem. Appl=
ication developers must
+analyze the warnings to make a proper assessment.
+
+The monitor's specification is::
+
+  RULE =3D always ((RT and SLEEP) imply (RT_FRIENDLY_SLEEP or ALLOWLIST))
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_SLEEP =3D (RT_VALID_SLEEP_REASON or KERNEL_THREAD)
+                  and ((not WAKE) until RT_FRIENDLY_WAKE)
+
+  RT_VALID_SLEEP_REASON =3D FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI
+                       or RT_FRIENDLY_NANOSLEEP
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_NANOSLEEP =3D CLOCK_NANOSLEEP
+                      and NANOSLEEP_TIMER_ABSTIME
+                      and NANOSLEEP_CLOCK_MONOTONIC
+
+  RT_FRIENDLY_WAKE =3D WOKEN_BY_EQUAL_OR_HIGHER_PRIO
+                  or WOKEN_BY_HARDIRQ
+                  or WOKEN_BY_NMI
+                  or KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP
+
+  ALLOWLIST =3D BLOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX
+           or FUTEX_LOCK_PI
+           or TASK_IS_RCU
+           or TASK_IS_MIGRATION
+
+Beside the scenarios described above, this specification also handle some =
special cases:
+
+  - `KERNEL_THREAD`: kernel tasks do not have any pattern that can be reco=
gnized as valid real-time
+    sleeping reasons. Therefore sleeping reason is not checked for kernel =
tasks.
+  - `KTHREAD_SHOULD_STOP`: a non-real-time thread may stop a real-time ker=
nel thread by waking it
+    and waiting for it to exit (`kthread_stop()`). This wakeup is safe for=
 real-time.
+  - `ALLOWLIST`: to handle known false positives with the kernel.
+  - `BLOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX` is included in the allowlist due to its implementa=
tion. In the release path
+    of rt_mutex, a boosted task is de-boosted before waking the rt_mutex's=
 waiter. Consequently, the
+    monitor may see a real-time-unsafe wakeup (e.g. non-real-time task wak=
ing real-time task). This
+    is actually real-time-safe because preemption is disabled for the dura=
tion.
+  - `FUTEX_LOCK_PI` is included in the allowlist for the same reason as `B=
LOCK_ON_RT_MUTEX`.
