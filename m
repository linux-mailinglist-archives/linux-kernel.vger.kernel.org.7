Currently, besides MADV_COLLAPSE not setting TVA_ENFORCE_SYSFS, there is 
only one other instance where TVA_ENFORCE_SYSFS is not set, which is in 
the collapse_pte_mapped_thp() function, but I believe this is reasonable 
from the comments:

         /*
          * If we are here, we've succeeded in replacing all the native 
pages
          * in the page cache with a single hugepage. If a mm were to 
fault-in
          * this memory (mapped by a suitably aligned VMA), we'd get the 
hugepage
          * and map it by a PMD, regardless of sysfs THP settings. As 
such, let's
          * analogously elide sysfs THP settings here.
          */
         if (!thp_vma_allowable_order(vma, vma->vm_flags, 0, PMD_ORDER))
                 return SCAN_VMA_CHECK;

Sure.

Sure, will do. Thanks for reviewing.
