"The" vulnerability is what is fixed in the last commit id, and is what
is documented in the text of the CVE, specifically:

	In ia_css_3a_statistics_allocate(), there is no check on the allocation
	result of the rgby_data memory. If rgby_data is not successfully
	allocated, it may trigger the assert(host_stats->rgby_data) assertion in
	ia_css_s3a_hmem_decode(). Adding a check to fix this potential issue.

That has not changed here at all.  It's just that the ranges of git
versions for when Linux was vulnerable to this issue has been "tightened
up" to only reflect when it was possible for this to be a problem (i.e.
we now do not count the range of releases where the driver was not
present at all in the kernel tree.)

As this has only happened 2 times so far, it's a pretty rare occurance
given us allocating over 6000 CVEs.  And how exactly would that email
look like?

We are just changing the ranges here, we change ranges of where a kernel
is vulnerable all the time by adding new .vulnerable files to the tree
as people report them, and as fixes are backported to older stable
kernel trees.  That's much more important to you than this type of
change, right?

The simplest way is to send us patches to the repo that add .vulnerable
files for those CVE ids, like others have been doing.  Look at the git
history for many examples of this happening.

And yes, git ids are the most important thing, and now we have also
tightened up that range.  That can be shown in the diff to the dyad
file:

I don't see any multiple CVEs happening here for the same issue, so I do
not understand what you are referring to.

Again, try following the .dyad files.  I think that will help you out a
lot more.
