I don't see the exact issue here? v3 perf stat reported "<not 
supported>" for the uncore event, which is accurate, and continued on 
with the working event. Which seemed consistent with the change in perf 
record.

What use case would break exactly if we don't do the same for perf stat? 
If a user isn't specific about a PMU it should attempt to open wherever 
it can, if all fail then exit early.

Maybe there are no direct changes to perf stat, but the user facing 
behavior still changes. Now perf record ignores the bad uncore event, 
but perf stat doesn't, making it inconsistent. V3 was better in this regard.

I'm not sure if you are saying that you wouldn't expect there to be 
_any_ change to perf stat in V3? Or just that perf stat itself wasn't 
changed but things that it depends on were? I just want to make sure 
I've tested the right thing and we're talking about the same thing.

I double checked and rebuilt 20250828205930.4007284-1-irogers@google.com 
(v3) and still see the different behavior in perf stat that I posted above.
