'when mounted with [a particular option]'

AMDs bandwidth controls count in 1/8ths of 1GB/s - and you have to know you're running on
an AMD machine. I'm aiming for the arm64 support to be portable between Intel and RISC-V.

No idea, but its equally likely that I haven't found all the places this gets parsed by
user-space. I don't think we have a way of telling people using stable-kernels that we
might change the size of that field. It's pretty clear people don't anticipate it changing!

This is just the downside of exposing anything to user-space!

Hmmm, if you offline CPU-0 then kexec, then CPU-1 becomes the new CPU-0 and the numbers
get doled out differently.

I don't think the linux allocated CPU number is robust enough.

We could use the CPU number as seen when walking through the DT to make it stable, but
that would still be a third type of number. It would save the arch hook to swizzle the
bits, but changing the DT would change the numbers which doesn't happen with this scheme.

Let me know if that is what you prefer.
(I'll summarise this on the cover-letter/patch-1 of the incoming series)


Thanks,
