Interrupts are disabled so I can't imagine sleeping is a good idea...

Once you have installed the idmap, you'll need to call a function by its PA so
you are actually executing out of the idmap. And you will need to be in assembly
so you don't need the stack, and you'll need to switch TTBR1 to the reserved
pgtable, so that the CPU has no access to the swapper pgtable (which CPU 0 is
able to modify).

You may well be able to reuse __idmap_kpti_secondary in proc.S, or lightly
refactor it to work for both the existing idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings case,
and your case.

Thanks,
Ryan
