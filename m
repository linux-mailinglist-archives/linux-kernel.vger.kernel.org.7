I only notice the delay when I run modetest to get a list of available
resolutions since it's trying every resolution to see if it can
achieve the desired clock rate.

If I run modetest to set the resolution, it's not really noticeable
because it's really only trying

As a compromise, I could leave the LUT, and fall back to the manual
calculations to both speed up the modetest look up, but to also
maximize the ability to sync new resolutions.  Even with what I have,
it's not perfect.  I skipped a few variables since my testing showed
they didn't have a huge impact and adding them increased the number of
calculations to determine the resolution.

No worries. I am just glad this driver is getting some love and enhancement=
