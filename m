This patch adds three device nodes.

Other patches add one node. Some other remove the lines which were
added before!

The last argument is the most important. I don't say anything new...
If you add code, which you immediately remove, you do it wrong.

Ack. Plus argument of actual patch line count
So maybe two SoC patches? Maybe three?

Not happy about this either, but understand the principle and business
choices, thus I don't comment on that.

Ack, plus reorganize patches which are removing code added in previous patc=
h.

Disappointing is only that I had this exactly talk with Qualcomm two
years ago and year ago and 2 months ago (QCS), and maybe more...

I'm sure that we had a internal meeting about Glymur and I said the
same. I emphasized this issue. Look at Glymur DTS - did my internal
emphasizing succeed?

No. I can speak on mailing lists every year, I can have internal
meeting(s) and it doesn't work.

Plus the timing of merge window with these two huge patch bombs is
just cherry on top.
