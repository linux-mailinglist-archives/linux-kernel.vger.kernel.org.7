FYI, I'm using drgn package on Debian 12, which says

    $ drgn --version
    drgn 0.0.30+82.ge2b60e4b (using Python 3.11.2, elfutils 0.188, without libkdumpfile)

Also I run a kernel built from damon/next[1], which is based on 6.15-rc6.

Sounds like a nice plan!

Thank you!  I'm not urgent or having a real problem with this at the moment,
though.  So, please take your time and fun!

Makes sense, thank you for sharing your wise thoughts.  This is very helpful to
me.
