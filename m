That is the commit information, and as such we deemed it a
vulnerability.

Ah, ok, that changes things.  The person who said that we should count
the previous version of the driver said it was vulnerable at that point
when it was in the kernel tree.  If this isn't the case, we will be glad
to change this CVE to reflect that.

Again, that would happen every stable release, and every -rc release,
could you really keep up with such an email flow in a way that wouldn't
just mirror watching the json feed instead?

.vulnerable files get added all the time, so hopefully you are catching
those updates :)
