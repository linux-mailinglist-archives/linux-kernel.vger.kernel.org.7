Sorry I didn't respond to this earlier.

Sticking to the names found in hardware documentation is
an easy rule to follow.  But sometimes when it's gathered
in code you see where things are inconsistent, which makes
the code less understandable.

The easiest is to just stick with the names you currently
use, which is fine with me.  There should probably be a
compelling reason to use different names, and in this case
the "RST" versus "RES" isn't super important.

Ideally every name you use should match what's in the
hardware documentation.  You could do a quick check for
any such differences.

In short:  what you use is fine; ignore my suggestion.

Unfortunately I think you're right.  You are including the clk_hw
structure in your initializations, and that can't be const.  You
could change this, but I won't suggest doing that now.  A lot
depends on this code being accepted, and I'd like not to delay
that.

Go ahead and leave out the blank lines I suggested.  It's
a simple coding style preference, and your grouping makes
sense.

Yes, you should explain it in the code.  It doesn't have to be
a complete explanation, but people reading the code aren't
always going to be looking at the bindings.  It's nice to know
why this is different from the others.

It might make sense but in part my suggestion makes more
sense when taken with the comment I had above (about having
a CCU structure with a union rather than separate per-type
structures).  I think that would be better, but again I
don't want you to have to do all that work if it means
delaying getting your code accepted.

So move it to the union if that works, but for now it's
fine the way it is.

Your choice.  My main point was about including "mask" in
the name.

Yes, what you have is fine.

Honestly, I'd really just rather see you calling regmap_read()
in your code.  And... check its return value.

But you do what you like.

OK I took another look at this.  And I looked at the first commit
that used this function to understand how to use it:
   534fca068ec80 imx: serial: use rational library function

You want to know what are the best available numerator and
denominator values to use (which fit into your register fields).
These should be as close as possible to the fraction you're after.

     Fout = Fin * num / denom

Fin is the parent rate (always divided by two in this case),
or "prate / 2".  Fout is the desired rate, or "rate".  You might
get a better result if you express the "/ 2" in the parent rate
as "* 2" in the desired rate.

     num_max = ddn->num_mask >> __ffs(ddn->num_mask);
     den_max = ddn->den_mask >> __ffs(ddn->den_mask);
     rational_best_approximation(rate * 2, prate,
				num_max, den_max, &num, &den)

In other words, your original code was more or less right,
with the numerator and denominator reversed.

OK, maybe this was why I was confused?  Probably not.

Consistency is pretty much always your friend.

In this case I think it wasn't obvious to me while reading what
the type of the initialized struct was, and I needed to go look
at where it was used to understand.  If the compiler doesn't
complain it's fine, don't change it.

Now I see, you're relying on anonymous objects like the common clock
framework does.  And it sounds like my general view as I was reading
the code was more like option 1.

I think either one is fine, which means what you did is OK as-is.

The layers of macros for initializing these things make it a little
harder to follow.

I'm not sure, my point was about using white space consistently.

What I can tell you is that I see the warning, perhaps when
I'm using the clock.  I'll try to narrow down a test case but
right now I don't have one.

I added code to report the swcr1 and swcr3 values but I don't
have those right now.

Looking at this function again, it seems you might as
well simply do this:

{
	return rate;
}

As it is, you loop through all the rates and exit the loop
if you find an entry whose rate is higher than the one passed
as an argument.

But... that's it.  You return rate, and never change it during
the function.


Aside from that, my point was more about what I *think* you
intended this function to do, which is to find the closest
rate to the one provided.  I was suggesting you were picking
the first entry found less than or equal to the requested
rate, but that wasn't necessarily the closest.

Rather than describe what I mean, I'll provide some code.

     unsigned long best_delta = ULONG_MAX;
     long best_rate = rate;    /* maybe -EERROR? */

     for (i = 0; i < params->tbl_size; i++) {
	unsigned long table_rate = params->rate_tbl[i].rate;
         unsigned long delta = abs_diff(table_rate, rate);

         if (delta < best_delta) {
             best_delta = delta;
             best_rate = table_rate;
         }
	if (table_rate > rate)
             break;         /* if your table is sorted by rate */
     }

     return best_rate;

And thank you for your good responses.
