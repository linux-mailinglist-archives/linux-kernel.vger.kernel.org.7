This is indeed the motivation - let every arch do whatever it sees fit.
lazy_mmu_state_t is basically an opaque type as far as generic code is
concerned, which also means that this API change is the first and last
one we need (famous last words, I know). 

I mentioned in the cover letter that the pkeys-based page table
protection series [1] would have an immediate use for lazy_mmu_state_t.
In that proposal, any helper writing to pgtables needs to modify the
pkey register and then restore it. To reduce the overhead, lazy_mmu is
used to set the pkey register only once in enter(), and then restore it
in leave() [2]. This currently relies on storing the original pkey
register value in thread_struct, which is suboptimal and most
importantly doesn't work if lazy_mmu sections nest. With this series, we
could instead store the pkey register value in lazy_mmu_state_t
(enlarging it to 64 bits or more).

I also considered going further and making lazy_mmu_state_t a pointer as
Alexander suggested - more complex to manage, but also a lot more flexible.

This discussion also made me realise that this is problematic, as the
LAZY_MMU_{DEFAULT,NESTED} macros were meant only for architectures'
convenience, not for generic code (where lazy_mmu_state_t should ideally
be an opaque type as mentioned above). It almost feels like the kasan
case deserves a different API, because this is not how enter() and
leave() are meant to be used. This would mean quite a bit of churn
though, so maybe just introduce another arch-defined value to pass to
leave() for such a situation - for instance,
arch_leave_lazy_mmu_mode(LAZY_MMU_FLUSH)?

The pagefault_disabled approach works fine for simple use-cases, but it
doesn't scale well. The space allocated in task_struct/thread_struct to
track that state is wasted (unused) most of the time. Worse, it does not
truly enable states to be nested: it allows the outermost section to
store some state, but nested sections cannot allocate extra space. This
is really what the stack is for.
