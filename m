My assumption was that FIXUPs in modules are only legitimate if they
apply to a dependency chain that involves the module they are built
into. So for example, the fixup could apply to a bridge that is
supported only by the module (driver) in question; or it could apply
only to devices that sit under the controller in question [1].

Everything I see that could potentially be in a module works like this
AFAICT.

To answer your question: no, the fixup should not be done twice, unless
the device is removed and recreated. More below.

[1] The quirks in drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pci-keystone.c look like
this. (Side note: pci-keystone.c cannot be built as a module today.)

With my assumption above, none of this would really be needed. The
relevant device(s) will only exist after the module is loaded, and they
will go away when the module is gone.

Or am I misreading your problem statements?

FWIW, I believe some folks are working on making *more* controller
drivers modular. So this problem will bite more people. (Specifically, I
believe Manivannan was working on
drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-qcom.c, and it has plenty of FIXUPs.)

I also don't think it makes things much less predictable, as long as
developers abide by my above assumption. I think that's a perfectly
reasonable assumption (it's not so different than, say,
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE), but I could perhaps be convinced otherwise.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but it seems like it'd be pretty easy
to do something like:

#ifdef MODULE
#define DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_SECTION...) BUILD_BUG()
#else
... real definitions ...
#endif

I'd prefer not doing this though, if we can help it, since I believe
(a) FIXUPs are useful in perfectly reasonable ways for controller
    drivers and
(b) controller drivers can potentially be modules (yes, there are some
    pitfalls besides $subject).

Right, either we support FIXUPs in modules, or we should outlaw them.

For kunit: we could still add tests, but just force them to be built-in.
It wouldn't be the first kernel subsystem to need that.
