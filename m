Well sure, but what if we can't initialize them (yet) at the time we create the
debugfs root?

Also, what if the data that should be exposed through a file in debugfs is not
supposed to live for the full lifetime of the debugfs root (which might be
forever)?

Yes, I'm aware of this possibility and its complexity. That's why I think per
file would suit better.

I don't think something like that is desirable.

Sure, or some other kind of synchronization. I left that aside, since it's not
relevant for the point I wanted to make. Which is that with the per root data
approach we'd need to work with Option types when the data isn't yet known when
the root directory is created and if we want to be able to free the data before
the root directory is removed (which might be never).

Why not treat File as container, i.e. make the property of an object a File<T>
with T being the property?

I can't follow what you mean here. Files in a C driver do need a handle to the
data they expose too, no?

Why do you think that this would be "the normal idimatic way" of doing this?

Does this imply that you think tying the lifetime of the object exposing a value
to the value itself wouldn't be idiomatic for Rust?
