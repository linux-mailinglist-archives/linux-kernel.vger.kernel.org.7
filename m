David pointed out some exceptions - the recency of dying processes might
still be useful to new processes, particularly in cases like:

  while true; do app; done

Here, 'app' is repeatedly restarted but always maintains a single running
instance. I agree this seems correct.

However, we can also find many cases where a dying process means its folios
instantly become cold. For example:
- If someone enjoys watching his/her TV (not shared with family) and then
  passes away, the TV's folios become instantly cold.
- Even if the TV is shared with family but only that person actively used
  it, the folios still become cold.  If other users access this TV
too, shouldn't
  their PTEs reflect that it's still young?

I agree that "access locality and recent use" is generally a good heuristic=
,
but it must have some correlation (strong or weak) with the process lifecyc=
le.
Implementing 'madv_cold' on a dying process seems impractical as dying
means 'cold' for many cases. Also, It is really not doable to execute
madv_cold on a dying process.

Thanks
Barry
