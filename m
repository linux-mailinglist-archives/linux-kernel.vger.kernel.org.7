Hi Ian,

Sorry for the delay.

The first part looks ok.  It'd be nice if you can send it separately.

I think it's ok to move hardware events to JSON as well.  Then we can
probably remove the hard coded parsing code.

The tricky part is the hybrid machines.  Would it be possible to define
common hardware with standard (legacy) encoding and to mark it "weak" or
overridable by arch-specific events with the same name?

Yep, it's merged now.  Please rebase the series.

As I said, moving the hardware events would be a solution as long as it
can handle complexities in hybrid.

Hmm.. I think it can be checked at runtime.  And maybe it can ask users
to install the required packages.

Sounds good.
