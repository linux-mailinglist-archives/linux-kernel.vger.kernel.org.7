I think we are talking about SN_DPPLL_SRC_REG[3:1] bits?
What exact mismatch are you observing in register value?

I am assuming that you have a clock at REFCLK pin. For that:

If refclk is described in devicetree node, then I see that
the driver modifies it in every resume call based solely on the
clock value in dts.

If refclk is not described in dts, then this register is modified by the
driver only when pre_enable() calls enable_comms(). Here also, the
value depends on crtc_mode and the refclk_rate often would not be equal
to the values in "ti_sn_bridge_dsiclk_lut" (supported frequencies), and
you would fallback to "001" register value.
Rest of time, I guess it depends on reading the status from GPIO and
changing the register.

Is the latter one your usecase?
