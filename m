Platform Firmware (BIOS) might reserve physical addresses below 4 GB where a
memory gap such as the Low Memory Hole for PCIe MMIO may exist.

So in the first paragraph, HPA is said to be described by CFMWS. But here a
brand new term SPA is introduced. I think you may need a paragraph above this
to talk about SPA vs HPA and SPA's relationship to CFMWS. Otherwise I think unless
the reader is knowledgeable all this, it is very confusing.
