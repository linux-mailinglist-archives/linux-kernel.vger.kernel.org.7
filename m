Hello Rob,

The reason to introduce new bindings for mux-controller is to make use
of it to implement Timesync Router. Timesync Router module provides a
mechanism to mux M interrupt inputs to N interrupt outputs, where all M
inputs are selectable to be driven per N ouput.

More details about Timesync Router can be found in section 11.3.2.1 of
TRM at: https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruiu1d/spruiu1d.pdf

Timesync Router is identical to mux-controller, but the issue to use
mux-controller subsystem for it is it's current binding. As it is
discussed in the series, drawback of this approach is, while configuring
mux-controller one need to specify every register of memory space with
offset and mask in "mux-reg-masks" and "idle-states" property, it would
be complex for the devices with large memory space. To overcome this
limitation, new bindings are introduced, which allows to define all
these values in the same property, making it easy to define and extend
the mux-controller node.

We tried to implement Timesync Router by modeling it as an Interrupt
Router. But that is not accepted, RFC series for that is at:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250205160119.136639-1-c-vankar@ti.com/.

Also we tried to implement it as a new driver in MUX subsystem, but that
is almost identical to "mmio.c" driver, which I posted it as this
series.

I want your suggestion on whether a new bindings can be acceptable and
we can use the same to implement Timesync Router, if not can you please
advice me on how can I implement it ?

Regards,
Chintan.
