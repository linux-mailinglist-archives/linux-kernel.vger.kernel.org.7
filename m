I've been chasing weird suspend bugs on our platform (another soc) for
the best of the month so it'd be greatly appreciated, sorry.

Feel free to replace our patch with anything equivalent

Yes I think it will make the intent more clear, if we're going to share
some code or make it more consistent might as well go all the way.

Hmm, tough question... I don't think we want displays to show up a few
seconds later, we regularily get mails from customers asking how to get
a logo to show up faster on display (I think there may be some variant
of uboot that supports imx8mp hdmi? but we don't have that), so while I
see the appeal of not having an hardcoded look up table I'm not sure we
would appreciate that compromise.

I think it'd be great to just have a way of checking the values in the
LUT are correct though (either statically from Frieder's python code as
I started doing or through a CONFIG_WHATEVER_CHECK_LUT config item
that'd check once at boot, although that's probably overkill); I started
checking from the python code but they weren't computed with the same
algorithm so some values end up being different even if theend result is
the same frequency and I stopped halfway...

Happy to test/review anything you send, but I make no promise on delays
:-)
