I might be wrong but there is currently a limitation on the OF system
where if a driver gets probed for a node then it's ignored for any other
driver. (sorry for the bad explaination, hope it's understandable)

This was an example to put every properties in the oparent node.

The SCU driver is actually the clock driver (currently). This was done
for simplicity and because in SCU there were only some bits.

But now with AN7583 they put 2 MDIO controller in it.

Then I think we are getting confused because I am following the usual
pattern.

This is what would be the ideal and easy solution. (ti what was done on
EN7581 with pinctrl and pwm)

		scu: system-controller@1fa20000 {
			compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd";
			reg = <0x0 0x1fb00000 0x0 0x970>;

			scuclk: scuclk {
				compatible = "airoha,an7583-scu";
				#clock-cells = <1>;
				#reset-cells = <1>;
			};

			mdio {
				compatible = "airoha,an7583-mdio";
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				mdio_0: bus@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					resets = <&scuclk AN7583_MDIO0>;
				};

				mdio_1: bus@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					resets = <&scuclk AN7583_MDIO1>;
				};
			};
		};

Ok to describe the HW for this register block

SCU register:
- clock
- mdio controller 1
- mdio controller 2

So this is why I think a good matching node block is:

parent node (SCU register):
	- child 1 (clock)
	- child 2 (mdio controller)
		- child 1 (mdio bus 1)
		- child 2 (mdio bus 2)

Is it wrong to model the DT node this way?

To drop the compatible a dedicated MFD driver is needed (or adding code
in the clock driver to register the MDIO controller and that is net
clean code wise)

Ok extra driver is not a problem. Problem here is understand what is the
correct node structure cause there are various options.

If the register block is still not clear to you just tell me and will
try to describe it even more.
