The first phase of this work, which is already queued up, was to move
all of the source files that were using RIP_REL_REF() into
arch/x86/boot/startup to be built with -fPIC so that RIP_REL_REF()
could be removed.

The current phase is to separate code that really needs to live under
startup/ from code that doesn't. This is the bit that was
straight-forward for mapping the kernel (including the SME encryption
pieces) because they were already in dedicated source files, but not
so straight-forward for SEV-SNP.

In reality, the mechanical code movement in this phase is mostly in
the opposite direction, where things are separated into startup and
non-startup code at a high level of detail, and the latter is moved
out again.

Not sure what happened to the tip/x86/boot branch in the meantime, but
assuming that what was already queued up is still scheduled for the
next cycle, I don't think there are any parts of this series that
could be meaningfully rearranged. IOW, the SEV-SNP refactoring needs
to be completed first, which accounts for most of the code movement.
Then, implementing the confined symbol space is just a couple of
patches on top.
