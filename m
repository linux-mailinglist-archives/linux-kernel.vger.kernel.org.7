I think that's a misdiagnosis caused by not understanding the limited
circumstances in which the problem occurs.  To hit this problem, you
have to have a buffer_head allocated on the stack.  That doesn't happen
in many places:

fs/buffer.c:    struct buffer_head tmp = {
fs/direct-io.c: struct buffer_head map_bh = { 0, };
fs/ext2/super.c:        struct buffer_head tmp_bh;
fs/ext2/super.c:        struct buffer_head tmp_bh;
fs/ext4/mballoc-test.c: struct buffer_head bitmap_bh;
fs/ext4/mballoc-test.c: struct buffer_head gd_bh;
fs/gfs2/bmap.c: struct buffer_head bh;
fs/gfs2/bmap.c: struct buffer_head bh;
fs/isofs/inode.c:       struct buffer_head dummy;
fs/jfs/super.c: struct buffer_head tmp_bh;
fs/jfs/super.c: struct buffer_head tmp_bh;
fs/mpage.c:     struct buffer_head map_bh;
fs/mpage.c:     struct buffer_head map_bh;

It's far more common for buffer_heads to be allocated from slab and
attached to folios.  The other necessary condition to hit this problem
is that get_block() has to actually read the data from disk.  That's
not normal either!  Most filesystems just fill in the metadata about
the block and defer the actual read to when the data is wanted.  That's
the high-performance way to do it.

So our opportunity to catch this bug was highly limited by the fact that
we just don't run the codepaths that would allow it to trigger.

I agree that it's a narrow race window, but nevertheless KASAN did catch
it with ntfs and not with exfat.  The KASAN documentation states that
it can catch this kind of bug:

Generic KASAN supports finding bugs in all of slab, page_alloc, vmap, vmalloc,
stack, and global memory.

Software Tag-Based KASAN supports slab, page_alloc, vmalloc, and stack memory.

Hardware Tag-Based KASAN supports slab, page_alloc, and non-executable vmalloc
memory.

(hm, were you using hwkasan instead of swkasan, and that's why you
couldn't see it?)
