Which is not even upstream yet and eventually will support async VM_BIND too,
AFAIK.

Nouveau currently supports an address space width of 128TiB.

In general, we have to cover the range of some small laptop or handheld devices
to huge datacenter machines.

I just want to be sure that an arbitrary small limit doing the job for a small
device to not fail VK CTS can't regress the performance on large machines.

So, kindly try to prove that we're not prone to extreme performance regression
with a static value as you propose.

If you are referring to the credit mechanism in the scheduler for ring buffers,
that's a different case. Drivers know the size of their ring buffers exactly and
the scheduler has the responsibility of when to submit tasks to the ring buffer.
So the scheduler kind of owns the resource.

However, the throttle mechanism you propose is independent from the scheduler,
it depends on the available system memory, a resource the scheduler doesn't own.

I'm fine to make the unit credits as well, but in this case we really care about
the consumption of system memory, so we could just use an applicable unit.

Why? The component should use its own waitqueue. Subsequently, from your code
that releases the pre-allocated memory, you can decrement the counter through
the drm_throttle API, which automatically kicks its the waitqueue.

For instance from your VM_BIND IOCTL you can call

	drm_throttle_inc(value)

which blocks if the increment goes above the threshold. And when you release the
pre-allocated memory you call

	drm_throttle_dec(value)

which wakes the waitqueue and unblocks the drm_throttle_inc() call from your
VM_BIND IOCTL.

Another advantage is that, if necessary, we can make drm_throttle
(automatically) scale for the machines resources, which otherwise we'd need to
pollute the scheduler with.
