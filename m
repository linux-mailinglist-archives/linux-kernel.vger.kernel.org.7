The problem is, what exactly do these values mean? Is it documented
somewhere?

Experience i've had with this is that you don't need to be too
accurate. Devices generally work with 2ns.

What exactly does the tool do? Can you run it when the 'PHY' is adding
the delay and see how good the eye alignment is?

arch$ grep -hr "tx_delay =" | sort | uniq -c
      1 	tx_delay = <0x0>;
      4 	tx_delay = <0x10>;
      1 	tx_delay = <0x1a>;
      1 	tx_delay = <0x20>;
      3 	tx_delay = <0x21>;
      2 	tx_delay = <0x22>;
      5 	tx_delay = <0x24>;
      2 	tx_delay = <0x26>;
     15 	tx_delay = <0x28>;
      2 	tx_delay = <0x2a>;
     17 	tx_delay = <0x30>;
      1 	tx_delay = <0x3a>;
      3 	tx_delay = <0x3c>;
      3 	tx_delay = <0x42>;
      5 	tx_delay = <0x43>;
      2 	tx_delay = <0x44>;
      1 	tx_delay = <0x45>;
      1 	tx_delay = <0x46>;
      6 	tx_delay = <0x4f>;

So 0x30 is the most popular, and i expect it maps to 2ns. The 0x28
value is interesting, given that 0x2a is not used much. That makes me
think there might be a common PHY used with these boards which has a
small built in delay when it should not.

Correct. DT phy-mode describes the PCB. Does the PCB add the 2ns
delay.

Once you get to the MAC/PHY pair, what the MAC passes to the PHY is
about what remaining delays need adding. It could be nothing, because
the PCB adds the delay. It could be all of it, because neither the PCB
nor the MAC add the delays. It can also be nothing because the MAC has
already added the delays.

For linux, we have the policy that the PHY adds the delay, in an
attempt to try to make all systems the same. And most boards follow
this. And then we have a few systems that totally mess up delays, have
odd configuration knobs nobody knows what the do exactly, and put the
delays in the MAC.

It is not recommended, because of the policy that the PHY does the
delay... You can, if you make use of the rx-internal-delay-ps
properties, assuming both the MAC and PHY support them.

Sometimes both can add variable delays. Sometimes it is fixed 2ns.

I would actually prefer that these properties were not used, because
they indicate somebody messed up. If you read the RGMII standard, it
says a 2ns delay is required between the clock and the data. It is as
simple as that. If you need to fine tune it, it means one of:

The PCB is badly designed, care was not taken to ensure the PCB tracks
are the same length.

The MAC is badly designed, it does not add 0ns/2ns, but some other
delay.

The PHY is badly designed, it does not add 0ns/2ns, but some other
delay.

I don't have empirical data, but i get the feeling designs are getting
worse, there is more need to use fine tuning. So these
{rx|tx}-internal-delay-ps properties are needed. Maybe the board you
are using is as a whole badly designed and needs fine tuning. If it
does, you have to decide where to put the fine tuning. But i would
prefer the 'PHY' adds the basic 2ns delay, and if need be, the MAC can
add/remove some picoseconds.
