Just to make sure I've understood all this, I think what you are both saying is
we can create a single capability called ARM64_HAS_NO_BBML2_NOABORT of type
ARM64_CPUCAP_LOCAL_CPU_ERRATUM. Each CPU will then check it has BBML2 and is in
the MIDR allow list; If any of those conditions are not met, the CPU is
considered to have ARM64_HAS_NO_BBML2_NOABORT.

Then we have this helper:

static inline bool system_supports_bbml2_noabort(void)
{
	return system_capabilities_finalized() &&
	       !alternative_has_cap_unlikely(ARM64_HAS_NO_BBML2_NOABORT);
}

system_capabilities_finalized() is there to ensure an early call to this helper
returns false (i.e. the safe value before we have evaluated on all CPUs).
Because ARM64_HAS_NO_BBML2_NOABORT is inverted it would otherwise return true
prior to finalization.

I don't believe we need any second (SYSTEM or BOOT) feature. This is sufficient
on its own?

Thanks,
Ryan
