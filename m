Also modern kernels dont even implement the vsyscall page anymore.
At most it is implemented as a stub which will trigger the real syscall
which then gets handled properly.

A "real" vDSO would require quite some more infrastructure. And it is
not even clear if such a vDSO will make a difference on UML. In my
opinion if __vdso_getcpu() gets removed, the whole vDSO should go with
it. The code can still be easily restored from git.

Also the functionality to map the host vDSO and vsyscall page into UML
userspace looks very weird and error-prone. Maybe it can also go away.
