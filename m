Any plan on doing hardware accelerated/offloaded/parallelized zstd? :)

I'm confused. How does IAA give more memory savings, while having a
worse compression ratio? How do you define memory savings here?

Are you aware of the current kcompressd work:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250430082651.3152444-1-qun-wei.lin@mediatek.c=
om/

It basically offloads compression work into a separate kernel thread
(kcompressd), for kswapd reclaim.

This might provide you with a more natural place to perform batch
compression - instead of compressing one page at a time from the
worker thread's queue, you can grab a batch worth of pages and feed it
to IAA.

Downside is it only applies to indirect reclaim. Proactive and direct
reclaimers are not covered, unfortunately.

Yeah problem with readahead is you can potentially get different
backends in the batch, and modifying readahead code is pretty ugly :)
But we'll see...

Oh nice, looks like with batching, IAA is now better than zstd? :)

That's interesting. Looks like zstd sees lower zswap activities,
indicating it is indeed more efficient at freeing up memory to resolve
memory pressure, thanks to its better compression ratio. And yet, IAA
still wins in real time, which I assume is thanks to:

1. Latency: IAA is probably quite a bit faster than zstd.

2. Asynchrony: please correct me if I'm wrong, but looks like zstd is
synchronous, whereas IAA is asynchronous, so we will release the core
while waiting for the compression result? In that case, the
aforementioned kcompressd might close the gap a bit (although I have
not seen huge difference in performance in kernel building test,
specifically).

It'd be nice if we can do a hardware offloaded + parallelized zstd to
get the best of both worlds :)
