Like I said, a generic *driver* is great! I'm all for them. We should
have more of them! Generic bindings on the other hand are generally a
mistake. The problem is whether a generic driver works for you or not
can evolve in either direction. You add more things like described
below and then a generic driver doesn't work.

Yes, and you can add to the binding then, but you are stuck with what
you define now.

It is not an MFD currently, so you don't need an MFD driver. As I
said, that can evolve.

Drivers are bus specific, so you can't have a generic regmap driver.
There's only 4 nvmem drivers using regmap anyways. qcom-spmi-sdam is
one of them, and maybe one driver could handle that and Apple.

It all sounds a bit different from what's there on the M series, so
perhaps better not to mix the 2 just because it is all apple. The A
series stuff might have more in common with existing Dialog PMICs.
