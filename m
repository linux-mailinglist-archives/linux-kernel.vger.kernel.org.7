Last time I looked at the calls into SMM (which was quite a while ago), =
they were fairly recognizable sequences that would nicely cause VM exits=
.  So the VM would exit and we would invoke SMM on its behalf.

But it=E2=80=99s very very very common for VMX/SVM to be unavailable.

Has anyone tried running EFI at CPL3?

P.S. Forget about relying on AC to make EFI work. I doubt we can trust E=
FI to leave AC set.
