Hi, Bijan,

It's hard for me to understand what you want to do in your original
patch description.  SeongJae's description is helpful.  So, can you add
more description in the future version?

So, you will migrate allocated pages to follow new weight?  How to
interact with the weight specified by users explicitly?  Usually we will
respect explicit user policy.
