OK - Let us document that in the device tree then. For the i2c ports and
usb ports that are implemented in the cape, just add a documentation
note saying enabled for cape header or something for that effect. all
these main USB pins are dedicated functions anyways, so it is unlikely
to see capes that can even attempt to reuse the generic USB data pins
for alternate functions.

If folks do not use that header in some specific overlay, they can
disable the node based on at least some guidance from the documentation.

I understand the rationale, but, we as Linux community came to this
guideline:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dts-coding-style.rst#n207
"
Hardware components that are present on the board shall be placed in the
board DTS, not in the SoC or SoM DTSI
"

PB2 being an partial "SOM".

It is a trade-off unfortunately.

This is not an unknown problem, though not something pleasant to
live with. Linux community is always happy to review options around
this, there has been attempts to help standardize these daughter card
ecosystems in the past, but none have achieved acceptance.

What we have today is the scheme where we have dts and overlays and
ability to generate a dtb that stitches the two together in a specific
order. That is usually requested to be demonstrated to work prior to
acceptance in upstream. That provides folks at least one specific
combination of things that is known to work. (testing is a case of
effort spent by the community to test things - including overlay,
which is no different from the core dtb). But, yes, there is no do what
you want and it will just work option today.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
