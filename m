Subject: Re: [PATCH] cifs: Fix lstat() and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW to work on
 broken symlink nodes
To: =?UTF-8?Q?Pali_Roh=C3=A1r?= <pali@kernel.org>

Looks like Paulo's fix ("smb: client: fix regression with native SMB
symlinks") which has been in for-next for a while with no issues in
testing etc. does fix the regression.

I did verify that the simple act of creating symlink (e.g. to some UNC
name) on Windows and trying to do an "ls -l" or "stat" or "cp" does
regress without his patch and with his patch behaves as expected (e.g.
if you went to linux and created a symlink to "filethatdoesnotexist"
then with his patch the behavior for stat, cp, cp --no-dereference and
ls -l is the same for bad target on ext4 mounts locally as it is for
bad target on smb3 mount to Windows)

There may be ways to address corner cases in the future - but it does
clearly address the regression, and for those four operations (stat,
cp, cp --no-dereference and ls -l) now behaves as expected when you
have an unresolvable target path of a symlink.

Don't mind discussing a followon patch to address more corner cases
but his patch looks fine and multiple people have tried it and looked
at (not just me) so should be upstream soon
