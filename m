Hi Michal and YoungJun,

I am sorry for the late reply. I have briefly read through the patches
series the overall impression:
1)  Priority is not the best way to select which swap file to use per cgrou=
p.
The priority is assigned to one device, it is a per swap file local
change. The effect you want to see is actually a global one, how this
swap device compares to other devices. You actually want  a list at
the end result. Adjusting per swap file priority is backwards. A lot
of unnecessary usage complexity and code complexity come from that.
2)  This series is too complicated for what it does.

I have a similar idea, "swap.tiers," first mentioned earlier here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAF8kJuNFtejEtjQHg5UBGduvFNn3AaGn4ffyoOrEn=
XfHpx6Ubg@mail.gmail.com/

I will outline the line in more detail in the last part of my reply.

BTW, YoungJun and Michal, do you have the per cgroup swap file control
proposal for this year's LPC? If you want to, I am happy to work with
you on the swap tiers topic as a secondary. I probably don't have the
time to do it as a primary.

The swap allocator has gone through a complete rewrite. We need to
revisit whether the NUMA autobinding thing is still beneficial in the
new swap allocator. We need more data points. Personally I would like
to decouple the NUMA to the swap device. If the swap device needs more
sharding, we can do more sharding without NUMA nodes. Using NUMA nodes
is just one way of sharding. Should not be the only way to do
sharding. Coupling the swap device with NUMA nodes makes things really
complicated. It would need a lot of performance difference to justify
that kind of complexity.

+1. The swap tiers I have in mind is very close to what you describe

Yes, swap tiers has a hierarchy module story as well. Will talk about
that in a later part of the email.

Again, I really wish the swap file selection decouples from the NUMA nodes.

I want to abandon weight adjusting, focus on opt in or out.

I think adjusting a single swap file to impact the relative order is backwa=
rds.

OK. I want to abandon the weight-adjustment approach. Here I outline
the swap tiers idea as follows. I can probably start a new thread for
that later.

1) No per cgroup swap priority adjustment. The swap file priority is
global to the system.
Per cgroup swap file ordering adjustment is bad from the LRU point of
view. We should make the swap file ordering matching to the swap
device service performance. Fast swap tier zram, zswap store hotter
data, slower tier hard drive store colder data.  SSD in between. It is
important to maintain the fast slow tier match to the hot cold LRU
ordering.

2) There is a simple mapping of global swap tier names into priority range
The name itself is customizable.
e.g. 100+ is the "compress_ram" tier. 50-99 is the "SSD" tier, 0-55 is
the "hdd" tier.
The detailed mechanization and API is TBD.
The end result is a simple tier name lookup will get the priority range.
By default all swap tiers are available for global usage without
cgroup. That matches the current global swap on behavior.

3) Each cgroup will have "swap.tiers" (name TBD) to opt in/out of the tier.
It is a list of tiers including the default tier who shall not be named.

Here are a few examples:
e.g. consider the following cgroup hierarchy a/b/c/d, a as the first
level cgroup.
a/swap.tiers: "- +compress_ram"
it means who shall not be named is set to opt out,  optin in
compress_ram only, no ssd, no hard.
Who shall not be named, if specified, has to be the first one listed
in the "swap.tiers".

a/b/swap.tiers: "+ssd"
For b cgroup, who shall not be named is not specified, the tier is
appended to the parent "a/swap.tiers". The effective "a/b/swap.tiers"
become "- +compress_ram +ssd"
a/b can use both zswap and ssd.

Every time the who shall not be named is changed, it can drop the
parent swap.tiers chain, starting from scratch.

a/b/c/swap.tiers: "-"

For c, it turns off all swap. The effective "a/b/c/swap.tiers" become
"- +compress_ram +ssd -" which simplify as "-", because the second "-"
overwrites all previous optin/optout results.
In other words, if the current cgroup does not specify the who shall
not be named, it will walk the parent chain until it does. The global
"/" for non cgroup is on.

a/b/c/d/swap.tiers: "- +hdd"
For d, only hdd swap, nothing else.

More example:
 "- +ssd +hdd -ssd" will simplify to: "- +hdd", which means hdd only.
 "+ -hdd": No hdd for you! Use everything else.

Let me know what you think about the above "swap.tiers"(name TBD) proposal.

Chris
