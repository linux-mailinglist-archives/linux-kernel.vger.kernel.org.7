Hi Andreas,

I am going to work on a new iteration of this patch. Are you satisfied =
with the
answers Alice gave you w.r.t ForeignOwnable? My take is the same as =
hers: we
don't need it here. The code you linked to is more restrictive in the =
sense
that it requires an allocation, which is not the case currently.

Her solution will cater to the use case you've described, so this should =
be OK
on your end?

I think this was before Gary=E2=80=99s patch to improve the mapping of =

All your comments above are addressing the documentation that was =
deliberately
copied and pasted from C. IMHO, we should refrain from introducing our =
own
documentation in this case because it will just confuse users. Any =
changes here
should be proposed to the C side directly.
