Ok thanks, in the next revision I will also add info that
contextualises the possible
state transitions.

Yes, following your explanation below I see now.

I think I understand now:
SOFT_MODE means that one user requested a soft enable for the event,
however that does not guarantee that the event is not already enabled from
a previous standard enable (in which case the SOFT_DISABLED flag will
not be set as it would compromise the previous user).
So a soft disable request is needed to "undo" previous soft enables; this i=
n
consideration of the SOFT_DISABLED flag (telling if there is an active user
with a standard enable).

Many thanks! This really helps to better contextualize function expectation=
s
in the next revision of the patch.
