That would be another option. Could you elaborate on this, please?
If I understand you correctly, you mean to extend controller binding
(and driver) to take in an additional supply? If yes - I'm afraid that
will be hard to justify to USB controller folks - as per my
understanding bindings (and device's driver) shall describe the
physical specification of the device, and in this case the root
controller does not in fact provide powered rail(s), nor a way to
control it - its an external addition controlled by SoC's GPIO for a
specific device, so it shall be described as such. Perhaps Konrad
could share his view on this?

Ah perhaps I should have shared more examples, my bad.
Currently suggested solution, which in my opinion is not scalable:
* Add VID/PID (of every camera, iff known) to onboard usb driver [1]
* Define in DT as:
```
camera {
  compatible = "usb5986,1198";

  vdd-supply = <&vreg_cam_5p0>;
};
```

Proposed solution with dummy regulator consumer:
* No need to explicitly set VID/PID. Define in DT as:
```
camera {
  compatible = "regulator-dummy-consumer";

  vdd-supply = <&vreg_cam_5p0>;
};
```

The problem I am trying to solve is to avoid adding entries to various
USB drivers every time one would like to add a new DT for a new
platform (variant). Proposed solution is a device-agnostic regulator
consumer with PM capabilities, for devices that otherwise do not need
a driver. If there is an even simpler and/or more neat solution that I
missed that would be of course preferred, this was the simplest way I
could solve it.

But how would we approach the lack of particular information, in this
case all possible VID/PID for an embedded camera? VID/PID was
identified by checking the actual device, which does not rule out OEM
switching camera SKU on the next batch, same way they do with other
peripherals.
