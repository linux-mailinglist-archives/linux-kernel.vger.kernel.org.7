The QCom folks can review all this first because I don't care to review 
the 50+ binding (just bindings!) patches sent all at once right before 
the merge window.

One comment on commit messages though. Please explain how the h/w block 
is or isn't compatible with some existing platforms. Many just state the 
obvious "add a compatible" or such. I've yet to find what kaanapali is 
in relation to any other QCom chip. It may be the next SoC for the smart 
toaster market for all I know.
