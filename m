+=======================
+System Launch Integrity
+=======================
+
+:Author: Daniel P. Smith
+:Date: March 2025
+
+This document serves to establish a common understanding of what a system
+launch is, the integrity concern for system launch, and why using a Root of Trust
+(RoT) from a Dynamic Launch may be desirable. Throughout this document,
+terminology from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and National Institute for
+Standards and Technology (NIST) is used to ensure that a vendor natural language
+describes and references security-related concepts.
+
+System Launch
+=============
+
+There is a tendency to consider the classical power-on boot as the only means to
+launch an Operating System (OS) on a computer. In fact, driven by the
+Trusted Computing Group (TCG) architecture, modern processors are able to support
+two methods of system launch: Static Launch and Dynamic Launch.
+
+Static Launch
+-------------
+
+Static launch is the system launch associated with the power cycle of the CPU.
+Thus, static launch refers to the classical power-on boot where the
+initialization event is the release of the CPU from reset and the system
+firmware is the software payload that brings the system up to a running state.
+Since static launch is the system launch associated with the beginning of the
+power lifecycle of a system, it is therefore a fixed, one-time system launch.
+It is because of this that static launch is referred to and thought of as being
+"static".
+
+Dynamic Launch
+--------------
+
+Modern CPU architectures provide a mechanism to re-initialize the system to a
+"known good" state without requiring a power event. This re-initialization is the
+starting point for a dynamic launch and is referred to as The Dynamic Launch Event
+(DLE). The DLE functions by accepting a software payload, referred
+to as the Dynamic Configuration Environment (DCE), that execution is handed to
+after the DLE is invoked. The DCE is responsible for bringing the system back
+to a running state. Since the dynamic launch is not tied to a power event like the
+static launch is, this enables a dynamic launch to be initiated at any time
+and multiple times during a single power life cycle. This dynamism is the
+reasoning behind referring to this system launch as "dynamic".
+
+Because a dynamic launch can be conducted at any time during a single power
+life cycle, it is classified as either one of two types: an early launch or a
+late launch.
+
+:Early Launch: A dynamic launch that is used as a transition from a static
+   launch chain to the final Operating System.
+
+:Late Launch: A dynamic launch by an executing Operating System to
+   transition to a "known good" state to perform one or more operations, e.g. to
+   launch into a new Operating System.
+
+System Integrity
+================
+
+For software systems, there are two system states for which the integrity of the
+software is critical: when it is loaded into memory and when it is executing on the
+hardware. Ensuring that the expected software is loaded into memory is referred to
+as load-time integrity. Ensuring that the software executing is the expected
+payload is the runtime integrity of that software.
+
+Load-time Integrity
+-------------------
+
+Load-time integrity is when a trusted entity, i.e. an entity with an assumed
+integrity, takes an action to assess an entity being loaded into memory before
+it is used. A variety of mechanisms may be used to conduct the assessment, each
+with different properties. A particular property is whether the mechanism creates
+an evidence of the assessment. Often either cryptographic signature checking or
+hashing are the common assessment operations used.
+
+A signature checking assessment functions by requiring a representation of the
+accepted authorities and uses those representations to assess if the entity has
+been signed by an accepted authority. The benefit of this process is that it
+includes an adjudication of the assessment. The drawbacks are that 1) the adjudication
+is susceptible to tampering by the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), 2) there is no
+evidence to assert that an untampered adjudication was completed, and 3) the system
+must be an active participant in the key management infrastructure.
+
+A cryptographic measurement does not adjudicate the assessment, but
+instead generates evidence of the assessment to be adjudicated independently.
+The benefit to this approach is that the assessment may be simplified such that it
+can be implemented in an immutable mechanism, e.g. in hardware.  Additionally,
+it is possible for the adjudication to be conducted where it cannot be tampered
+with by the TCB. The drawback is that a compromised environment will be allowed
+to execute until an adjudication can be completed.
+
+Ultimately, load-time integrity provides confidence that the correct entity was
+loaded and in the absence of a run-time integrity mechanism assumes, i.e.
+trusts, that the entity will never become corrupted.
+
+Runtime Integrity
+-----------------
+
+Runtime integrity, in the general sense, is when a trusted entity makes an
+assessment of another entity at any point in time during the assessed entity's
+execution. A more concrete explanation is the taking of an integrity assessment
+of an active process executing on the system at any point during the process'
+execution. Often the load-time integrity of an operating system's user-space,
+i.e. the operating environment, is confused with the runtime integrity of the
+system, since it is an integrity assessment of the "runtime" software. The
+reality is that actual runtime integrity is a very difficult problem and thus
+not very many solutions are public and/or available. One example of a runtime
+integrity solution would be Johns Hopkins Advanced Physics Laboratory's (APL)
+Linux Kernel Integrity Module (LKIM).
+
+Trust Chains
+============
+
+Building upon the understanding of security mechanisms to establish load-time
+integrity of an entity, it is possible to chain together load-time integrity
+assessments to establish the integrity of the whole system. The process of
+creating this chain involves using a series of transitive trust assertions to
+establish confidence in the load-time integrity of each component loaded.
+
+This process is known as transitive trust and provides the concept of building
+a chain of load-time integrity assessments, commonly referred to as a trust
+chain. These assessments may be used to adjudicate the load-time integrity of
+the whole system. This trust chain is started by a trusted entity that does the
+first assessment. This first entity is referred to as the Root of Trust (RoT)
+with the entity's name being derived from the mechanism used for the assessment,
+i.e. RoT for Verification (RTV) and RoT for Measurement (RTM).
+
+A trust chain is itself a mechanism, specifically a mechanism of mechanisms,
+and therefore it also has a Strength of Mechanism. The factors that contribute
+to the strength of a trust chain are:
+
+  - The strength of the chain's RoT
+  - The strength of each member of the trust chain
+  - The length (i.e. the number of members) of the chain
+
+Therefore, the strongest trust chains should start with a strong RoT,
+consist of members being of low complexity, and minimize the number of members
+participating. In a more colloquial sense, a trust chain is only as strong as its
+weakest link, therefore more links increase the probability of a weak link.
+
+Dynamic Launch Components
+=========================
+
+The TCG architecture for dynamic launch is composed of a component series
+used to set up and then carry out the launch. These components work together to
+construct an RTM trust chain rooted in the dynamic launch, commonly
+referred to as the Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM) chain.
+
+.. note::
+    Intel TXT pre-dates the TCG Dynamic Launch specification. In the Intel TXT
+    documentation, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement was abbreviated as DRTM.
+    When Dynamic Launch was codified in the TCG specification, it was given
+    the acronym D-RTM. There is a similar situation with Static Root of Trust for
+    Measuremnt. In TCG documentation it will be given the acronym S-RTM but it is not
+    uncommon to see it as SRTM. For the purposes of the launch integrity documents,
+    DRTM and SRTM will be the preferred acronym.
+
+What follows is a brief explanation of each component in execution order. A
+subset of these components is what establishes the dynamic launch's trust
+chain.
+
+Dynamic Configuration Environment Preamble
+------------------------------------------
+
+The Dynamic Configuration Environment (DCE) Preamble is responsible for setting
+up the system environment in preparation for a dynamic launch. The DCE Preamble
+is not a part of the DRTM trust chain.
+
+Dynamic Launch Event
+--------------------
+
+The dynamic launch event is the event, typically a CPU instruction, that
+triggers the system's dynamic launch mechanism to begin the launch process. The
+dynamic launch mechanism is also the RoT for the DRTM trust chain.
+
+Dynamic Configuration Environment
+---------------------------------
+
+The dynamic launch mechanism may have resulted in a reset of a portion of the
+system. To bring the system back to an adequate state for system software, the
+dynamic launch will hand over control to the DCE. Prior to handing over this
+control, the dynamic launch will measure the DCE. Once the DCE is complete, it
+will proceed to measure and then execute the Dynamic Launch Measured
+Environment (DLME).
+
+Dynamic Launch Measured Environment
+-----------------------------------
+
+The DLME is the first system kernel to have control of the system, but may not
+be the last. Depending on the usage and configuration, the DLME may be the
+final/target operating system, or it may be a bootloader that will load the
+final/target operating system.
+
+Why DRTM?
+=========
+
+A DRTM solution increases the load-time integrity of the system by
+providing a trust chain that has an immutable hardware RoT and uses a limited
+number of small, special purpose code to establish the trust chain that starts
+the target operating system. As mentioned in the Trust Chain section, these are
+three main factors in driving up the strength of a trust chain. As has been
+seen with the BootHole exploit (which in fact did not affect the integrity of
+DRTM solutions), the sophistication of attacks targeting system launch is at an
+all-time high. There is no reason a system should not employ every available
+hardware integrity measure. This is the crux of a defense-in-depth
+approach to system security.
+
+In the past, the now closed SMI gap was often pointed to as invalidating DRTM.
+As has continued to be demonstrated, if/when SMM is corrupted, it can
+always circumvent all load-time integrity (SRTM and DRTM) because it is a
+run-time integrity problem. Regardless, Intel and AMD have both deployed
+runtime integrity for SMI and SMM which is tied directly to DRTM such that this
+perceived deficiency is now non-existent. The world is moving forward with
+an expectation that DRTM must be present.

+Secure Launch Config and Interfaces
+===================================
+
+:Author: Daniel P. Smith
+:Date: March 2025
+
+Configuration
+=============
+
+The settings to enable Secure Launch using Kconfig are under::
+
+  "Processor type and features" --> "Secure Launch support"
+
+A kernel with this option enabled can still be booted using other supported
+methods.
+
+To reduce the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the MLE [1]_, the build
+configuration should be pared down as narrowly as one's use case allows.
+Fewer drivers (less active hardware) and features reduce the attack surface.
+As an example in the extreme, the MLE could only have local disk access with no
+other hardware supports except optional network access for remote attestation.
+
+It is also desirable, if possible, to embed the initrd used with the MLE kernel
+image to reduce complexity.
+
+The following are important configuration necessities to always consider:
+
+KASLR Configuration
+-------------------
+
+Due to Secure Launch hardware implementation details and how KASLR functions,
+Secure Launch is not able to interoperate with KASLR at this time. Attempts to
+enable KASLR in a kernel started using Secure Launch may result in crashes and
+other instabilities at boot. Even in cases where Secure Launch and KASLR work
+together, it is still recommended that KASLR be disabled to avoid introducing
+security concerns with unprotected kernel memory.
+
+If possible, a kernel being used as an MLE should be built with KASLR disabled::
+
+  "Processor type and features" -->
+      "Build a relocatable kernel" -->
+          "Randomize the address of the kernel image (KASLR) [ ]"
+
+This action unsets the Kconfig value CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE.
+
+If it is not possible to disable at build time, then it is recommended to force
+KASLR to be disabled using the kernel command line when doing a Secure Launch.
+The kernel parameter is as follows::
+
+  nokaslr
+
+.. note::
+    Should KASLR be made capable of reading/using only the protected page
+    regions set up by the memory protection mechanisms used by the hardware
+    DRTM capability, it would then become possible to use KASLR with Secure
+    Launch.
+
+IOMMU Configuration
+-------------------
+
+When doing a Secure Launch, the IOMMU should always be enabled and the drivers
+loaded. However, IOMMU passthrough mode should never be used. This leaves the
+MLE completely exposed to DMA after the PMRs [2]_ are disabled. The current
+default mode is to use IOMMU in lazy translated mode, but strict translated
+mode is the preferred IOMMU mode and this should be selected in the build
+configuration::
+
+  "Device Drivers" -->
+      "IOMMU Hardware Support" -->
+          "IOMMU default domain type" -->
+              "(X) Translated - Strict"
+
+In addition, the Intel IOMMU should be on by default. The following sets this as the
+default in the build configuration::
+
+  "Device Drivers" -->
+      "IOMMU Hardware Support" -->
+          "Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices [*]"
+
+and::
+
+  "Device Drivers" -->
+      "IOMMU Hardware Support" -->
+          "Support for Intel IOMMU using DMA Remapping Devices [*]" -->
+              "Enable Intel DMA Remapping Devices by default  [*]"
+
+It is recommended that no other command line options should be set to override
+the defaults above. If there is a desire to run an alternate configuration,
+then that configuration should be evaluated for what benefits might
+be gained against the risks for DMA attacks to which the kernel is likely
+going to be exposed.
+
+Secure Launch Resource Table
+============================
+
+The Secure Launch Resource Table (SLRT) is a platform-agnostic, standard format
+for providing information for the pre-launch environment and to pass
+information to the post-launch environment. The table is populated by one or
+more bootloaders in the boot chain and used by Secure Launch on how to set up
+the environment during post-launch. The details for the SLRT are documented
+in the TrenchBoot Secure Launch Specification [3]_.
+
+Intel TXT Interface
+===================
+
+The primary interfaces between the various components in TXT are the TXT MMIO
+registers and the TXT heap. The MMIO register banks are described in Appendix B
+of the TXT MLE [1]_ Development Guide.
+
+The TXT heap is described in Appendix C of the TXT MLE [1]_ Development
+Guide. Most of the TXT heap is predefined in the specification. The heap is
+initialized by firmware and the pre-launch environment and is subsequently used
+by the SINIT ACM. One section, called the OS to MLE Data Table, is reserved for
+software to define. This table is set up per the recommendation detailed in
+Appendix B of the TrenchBoot Secure Launch Specification::
+
+        /*
+         * Secure Launch defined OS/MLE TXT Heap table
+         */
+        struct txt_os_mle_data {
+                u32 version;
+                u32 reserved;
+                u64 slrt;
+                u64 txt_info;
+                u32 ap_wake_block;
+                u32 ap_wake_block_size;
+                u8 mle_scratch[64];
+        } __packed;
+
+Description of structure:
+
+=====================  ========================================================================
+Field                  Use

+version                Structure version, current value 1
+slrt                   Physical address of the Secure Launch Resource Table
+txt_info               Pointer into the SLRT for easily locating TXT specific table
+ap_wake_block          Physical address of the block of memory for parking APs after a launch
+ap_wake_block_size     Size of the AP wake block
+mle_scratch            Scratch area used post-launch by the MLE kernel. Fields:
+ 
+                        - SL_SCRATCH_AP_EBX area to share %ebx base pointer among CPUs
+                        - SL_SCRATCH_AP_JMP_OFFSET offset to abs. ljmp fixup location for APs
+=====================  ========================================================================
+
+Error Codes
+-----------
+
+The TXT specification defines the layout for TXT 32 bit error code values.
+The bit encodings indicate where the error originated (e.g. with the CPU,
+in the SINIT ACM, in software). The error is written to a sticky TXT
+register that persists across resets called TXT.ERRORCODE (see the TXT
+MLE Development Guide). The errors defined by the Secure Launch feature are
+those generated in the MLE software. They have the format::
+
+  0xc0008XXX
+
+The low 12 bits are free for defining the following Secure Launch specific
+error codes.
+
+======  ================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_GENERIC
+Value:  0xc0008001
+======  ================
+
+Description:
+
+Generic catch all error. Currently unused.
+
+======  =================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_TPM_INIT
+Value:  0xc0008002
+======  =================
+
+Description:
+
+The Secure Launch code failed to get access to the TPM hardware interface.
+This is most likely due to misconfigured hardware or kernel. Ensure the TPM
+chip is enabled, and the kernel TPM support is built in (it should not be built
+as a module).
+
+======  ==========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_TPM_INVALID_LOG20
+Value:  0xc0008003
+======  ==========================
+
+Description:
+
+Either the Secure Launch code failed to find a valid event log descriptor for a
+version 2.0 TPM, or the event log descriptor is malformed. Usually this
+indicates incompatible versions of the pre-launch environment and the
+MLE kernel. The pre-launch environment and the kernel share a structure in the
+TXT heap and if this structure (the OS-MLE table) is mismatched, this error is
+common. This TXT heap area is set up by the pre-launch environment, so the
+issue may originate there. It could also be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ===========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_TPM_LOGGING_FAILED
+Value:  0xc0008004
+======  ===========================
+
+Description:
+
+There was a failed attempt to write a TPM event to the event log early in the
+Secure Launch process. This is likely the result of a malformed TPM event log
+buffer. Formatting of the event log buffer information is done by the
+pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely originates there.
+
+======  ============================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_REGION_STRADDLE_4GB
+Value:  0xc0008005
+======  ============================
+
+Description:
+
+During early validation, a buffer or region was found to straddle the 4Gb
+boundary. Because of the way TXT provides DMA memory protection, this is an unsafe
+configuration and is flagged as an error. This is most likely a configuration
+issue in the pre-launch environment. It could also be the sign of an attempted
+attack.
+
+======  ===================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_TPM_EXTEND
+Value:  0xc0008006
+======  ===================
+
+Description:
+
+There was a failed attempt to extend a TPM PCR in the Secure Launch platform
+module. This is most likely to due to misconfigured hardware or kernel. Ensure
+the TPM chip is enabled, and the kernel TPM support is built in (it should not
+be built as a module).
+
+======  ======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_VCNT
+Value:  0xc0008007
+======  ======================
+
+Description:
+
+During early Secure Launch validation, an invalid variable MTRR count was
+found. The pre-launch environment passes a number of MSR values to the MLE to
+restore including the MTRRs. The values are restored by the Secure Launch early
+entry point code. After measuring the values supplied by the pre-launch
+environment, a discrepancy was found, validating the values. It could be the
+sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ==========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_DEF_TYPE
+Value:  0xc0008008
+======  ==========================
+
+Description:
+
+During early Secure Launch validation, an invalid default MTRR type was found.
+See SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_VCNT for more details.
+
+======  ======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_BASE
+Value:  0xc0008009
+======  ======================
+
+Description:
+
+During early Secure Launch validation, an invalid variable MTRR base value was
+found. See SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_VCNT for more details.
+
+======  ======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_MASK
+Value:  0xc000800a
+======  ======================
+
+Description:
+
+During early Secure Launch validation, an invalid variable MTRR mask value was
+found. See SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_VCNT for more details.
+
+======  ========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MSR_INV_MISC_EN
+Value:  0xc000800b
+======  ========================
+
+Description:
+
+During early Secure Launch validation, an invalid miscellaneous enable MSR
+value was found. See SL_ERROR_MTRR_INV_VCNT for more details.
+
+======  =========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_INV_AP_INTERRUPT
+Value:  0xc000800c
+======  =========================
+
+Description:
+
+The application processors (APs) wait to be woken up by the SMP initialization
+code. The only interrupt that they expect is an NMI; all other interrupts
+should be masked. If an AP gets an interrupt other than an NMI, it will
+cause this error. This error is very unlikely to occur.
+
+======  =========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_INTEGER_OVERFLOW
+Value:  0xc000800d
+======  =========================
+
+Description:
+
+A buffer base and size passed to the MLE caused an integer overflow when
+added together. This is most likely a configuration issue in the pre-launch
+environment. It could also be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ==================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_WALK
+Value:  0xc000800e
+======  ==================
+
+Description:
+
+An error occurred in TXT heap walking code. The underlying issue is a failure to
+early_memremap() portions of the heap, most likely due to a resource shortage.
+
+======  =================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_MAP
+Value:  0xc000800f
+======  =================
+
+Description:
+
+This error is essentially the same as SL_ERROR_HEAP_WALK, but occurred during the
+actual early_memremap() operation.
+
+======  =========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_REGION_ABOVE_4GB
+Value:  0xc0008010
+======  =========================
+
+Description:
+
+A memory region used by the MLE is above 4Gb. In general this is not a problem
+because memory > 4Gb can be protected from DMA. There are certain buffers that
+should never be above 4Gb, and one of these caused the violation. This is most
+likely a configuration issue in the pre-launch environment. It could also be
+the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ==========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_INVALID_DMAR
+Value:  0xc0008011
+======  ==========================
+
+Description:
+
+The backup copy of the ACPI DMAR table which is supposed to be located in the
+TXT heap could not be found. This is due to a bug in the platform's ACM module
+or in firmware.
+
+======  =======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_DMAR_SIZE
+Value:  0xc0008012
+======  =======================
+
+Description:
+
+The backup copy of the ACPI DMAR table in the TXT heap is to large to be stored
+for later usage. This error is very unlikely to occur since the area reserved
+for the copy is far larger than the DMAR should be.
+
+======  ======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_DMAR_MAP
+Value:  0xc0008013
+======  ======================
+
+Description:
+
+The backup copy of the ACPI DMAR table in the TXT heap could not be mapped. The
+underlying issue is a failure to early_memremap() the DMAR table, most likely
+due to a resource shortage.
+
+======  ====================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HI_PMR_BASE
+Value:  0xc0008014
+======  ====================
+
+Description:
+
+On a system with more than 4Gb of RAM, the high PMR [2]_ base address should be
+set to 4Gb. This error is due to that not being the case. This PMR value is set
+by the pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely originates there. It
+could also be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ====================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HI_PMR_SIZE
+Value:  0xc0008015
+======  ====================
+
+Description:
+
+On a system with more than 4Gb of RAM, the high PMR [2]_ size should be set to
+cover all RAM > 4Gb. This error is due to that not being the case. This PMR
+value is set by the pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely originates
+there. It could also be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ====================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_LO_PMR_BASE
+Value:  0xc0008016
+======  ====================
+
+Description:
+
+The low PMR [2]_ base should always be set to address zero. This error is due
+to that not being the case. This PMR value is set by the pre-launch environment
+so the issue most likely originates there. It could also be the sign of an
+attempted attack.
+
+======  ====================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_LO_PMR_MLE
+Value:  0xc0008017
+======  ====================
+
+Description:
+
+This error indicates the MLE image is not covered by the low PMR [2]_ range.
+The PMR values are set by the pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely
+originates there. It could also be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  =======================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_INITRD_TOO_BIG
+Value:  0xc0008018
+======  =======================
+
+Description:
+
+The external initrd provided is larger than 4Gb. This is not a valid
+configuration for a Secure Launch due to managing DMA protection.
+
+======  =========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_HEAP_ZERO_OFFSET
+Value:  0xc0008019
+======  =========================
+
+Description:
+
+During a TXT heap walk, an invalid/zero next table offset value was found. This
+indicates the TXT heap is malformed. The TXT heap is initialized by the
+pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely originates there. It could
+also be a sign of an attempted attack. In addition, ACM is also responsible for
+manipulating parts of the TXT heap, so the issue could be due to a bug in the
+platform's ACM module.
+
+======  =============================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_WAKE_BLOCK_TOO_SMALL
+Value:  0xc000801a
+======  =============================
+
+Description:
+
+The AP wake block buffer passed to the MLE via the OS-MLE TXT heap table is not
+large enough. This value is set by the pre-launch environment, so the issue
+most likely originates there. It also could be the sign of an attempted attack.
+
+======  ===========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_MLE_BUFFER_OVERLAP
+Value:  0xc000801b
+======  ===========================
+
+Description:
+
+One of the buffers passed to the MLE via the OS-MLE TXT heap table overlaps
+with the MLE image in memory. This value is set by the pre-launch environment
+so the issue most likely originates there. It could also be the sign of an
+attempted attack.
+
+======  ==========================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_BUFFER_BEYOND_PMR
+Value:  0xc000801c
+======  ==========================
+
+Description:
+
+One of the buffers passed to the MLE via the OS-MLE TXT heap table is not
+protected by a PMR. This value is set by the pre-launch environment, so the
+issue most likely originates there. It could also be the sign of an attempted
+attack.
+
+======  =============================
+Name:   SL_ERROR_OS_SINIT_BAD_VERSION
+Value:  0xc000801d
+======  =============================
+
+Description:
+
+The version of the OS-SINIT TXT heap table is bad. It must be 6 or greater.
+This value is set by the pre-launch environment, so the issue most likely
+originates there. It could also be the sign of an attempted attack. It is also
+possible though very unlikely that the platform is so old that the ACM being
+used requires an unsupported version.

+Secure Launch Overview
+======================
+
+:Author: Daniel P. Smith
+:Date: March 2025
+
+Overview
+========
+
+The TrenchBoot project started the development of the Secure Launch kernel feature
+to provide a more generalized approach. The focus of the effort is twofold: first,
+to make the Linux kernel directly aware of the launch protocol used by platforms
+such as Intel, AMD/Hygon, Arm, and potentially OpenPOWER; second, to make the
+Linux kernel able to initiate a dynamic launch. It is through this approach that
+the Secure Launch kernel feature creates a basis for the Linux kernel to be used
+in a variety of dynamic launch use cases.
+
+.. note::
+    A quick note on terminology. The larger open source project itself is
+    called TrenchBoot, which is hosted on GitHub (links below). The kernel
+    feature enabling the use of the x86 technology is referred to as "Secure
+    Launch" within the kernel code.
+
+Goals
+=====
+
+The first use case that the TrenchBoot project focused on was the ability for
+the Linux kernel to be started by a dynamic launch, in particular as part of an
+early launch sequence. In this case, the dynamic launch will be initiated by
+any bootloader with associated support added to it. The first targeted bootloader
+in this case was GRUB2. An integral part of establishing a measurement-based
+launch integrity involves measuring everything that is intended to be executed
+(kernel image, initrd, etc.) and everything that will configure that kernel to
+execute (command line, boot params, etc.), then storing those measurements in a
+protected manner. Both the Intel and AMD dynamic launch implementations leverage
+the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to store those measurements. The TPM itself
+has been designed such that a dynamic launch unlocks a specific set of Platform
+Configuration Registers (PCR) for holding measurement taken during the dynamic
+launch. These are referred to as the DRTM PCRs, PCRs 17-22. Further details on this
+process can be found respectively in the documentation for the GETSEC instruction
+provided by Intel's TXT and the SKINIT instruction provided by AMD's AMD-V. The
+documentation on these technologies can be readily found online; see
+the `Resources`_ section below for references.
+
+.. note::
+    Currently, only Intel TXT is supported in this first release of the Secure
+    Launch feature. AMD/Hygon SKINIT and Arm support will be added in a
+    subsequent release.
+
+To enable the kernel to be launched by GETSEC, the Secure Launch stub
+must be built into the setup section of the compressed kernel to handle the
+specific state that the dynamic launch process leaves the BSP. Also, the Secure
+Launch stub must measure everything that is going to be used as early as
+possible. This stub code and subsequent code must also deal with the specific
+state that the dynamic launch leaves the APs in.
+
+Design Decisions
+================
+
+A number of design decisions were made during the development of the Secure
+Launch feature. The two primary guiding decisions were:
+
+ - Keeping the Secure Launch code as separate from the rest of the kernel
+   as possible.
+ - Modifying the existing boot path of the kernel as little as possible.
+
+The following illustrate how the implementation followed these design
+decisions:
+
+ - All the entry point code necessary to properly configure the system post
+   launch is found in st_stub.S in the compressed kernel image. This code
+   validates the state of the system, restores necessary system operating
+   configurations and properly handles post launch CPU states.
+ - After the sl_stub.S is complete, it jumps directly to the unmodified
+   startup_32 kernel entry point.
+ - A single call is made to a function sl_main() prior to the main kernel
+   decompression step. This code performs further validation and takes the
+   needed DRTM measurements.
+ - After the call to sl_main(), the main kernel is decompressed and boots as
+   it normally would.
+ - Support is introduced in the SMP boot code to properly wake the APs. This
+   is required due to the unique state the dynamic launch leaves the APs in
+   (i.e. they cannot be woken with the standard INIT-SIPI sequence).
+ - Final setup for the Secure Launch kernel is done in a separate Secure
+   Launch module that is loaded via a late initcall. This code is responsible
+   for extending the measurements taken earlier into the TPM DRTM PCRs and
+   setting up the securityfs interface to allow access to the TPM event log and
+   public TXT registers.
+ - On the reboot and kexec paths, calls are made to a function to finalize the
+   state of the Secure Launch kernel.
+
+A final note is that the original concept was to extend the DRTM PCRs in the
+Secure Launch stub when the measurements were taken. This requires access to the
+TPM early during boot time. Since the mainline kernel TPM driver relies heavily
+on kernel interfaces not available in the compressed kernel, it was not possible
+to reuse the mainline TPM driver. An alternate solution that has been implemented,
+moves the extension operations to the Secure Launch module in the mainline
+kernel, where the TPM driver would be available.
+
+Basic Boot Flow
+===============
+
+Outlined here is a summary of the boot flow for Secure Launch. A more detailed
+review of the Secure Launch process can be found in the Secure Launch
+Specification (a link is located in the `Resources`_ section).
+
+Pre-launch: *Phase where the environment is prepared and configured to initiate
+the secure launch by the boot chain.*
+
+ - The SLRT is initialized and dl_stub is placed in memory.
+ - Load the kernel, initrd and ACM [2]_ into memory.
+ - Set up the TXT heap and page tables describing the MLE [1]_ per the
+   specification.
+ - If non-UEFI platform, dl_stub is called.
+ - If UEFI platform, SLRT registered with UEFI and efi-stub called.
+ - Upon completion, efi-stub will call EBS followed by dl_stub.
+ - The dl_stub will prepare the CPU and the TPM for the launch.
+ - The secure launch is then initiated with the GETSET[SENTER] instruction.
+
+Post-launch: *Phase where control is passed from the ACM to the MLE and the secure
+kernel begins execution.*
+
+ - Entry from the dynamic launch jumps to the SL stub.
+ - SL stub fixes up the world on the BSP.
+ - For TXT, SL stub wakes the APs, fixes up their worlds.
+ - For TXT, APs are left halted using MONITOR/MWAIT intructions.
+ - SL stub jumps to startup_32.
+ - SL main does validation of buffers and memory locations. It sets
+   the boot parameter loadflag value SLAUNCH_FLAG to inform the main
+   kernel that a Secure Launch was done.
+ - SL main locates the TPM event log and writes the measurements of
+   configuration and module information into it.
+ - Kernel boot proceeds normally from this point.
+ - During early setup, slaunch_setup() runs to finish validation
+   and setup tasks.
+ - The SMP bring up code is modified to wake the waiting APs via the monitor
+   address.
+ - APs jump to rmpiggy and start up normally from that point.
+ - SL platform module is registered as a late initcall module. It reads
+   the TPM event log and extends the measurements taken into the TPM PCRs.
+ - SL platform module initializes the securityfs interface to allow
+   access to the TPM event log and TXT public registers.
+ - Kernel boot finishes booting normally.
+ - SEXIT support to leave SMX mode is present on the kexec path and
+   the various reboot paths (poweroff, reset, halt).
+
+PCR Usage
+=========
+
+In the TCG DRTM architecture there are three PCRs defined for usage: PCR.Details
+(PCR17), PCR.Authorities (PCR18), and PCR.DLME_Authority (PCR19). For a deeper
+understanding of Details and Authorities, review the TCG DRTM architecture
+documentation.
+
+To determine PCR usage, Linux Secure Launch follows the TrenchBoot Secure
+Launch Specification of using a measurement policy stored in the Secure Launch
+Resource Table (SLRT), which is defined in the Secure Launch Specification.
+This policy details what should be measured and the PCR in which to store the
+measurement. The measurement policy provides the ability to select the
+PCR.DLME_Detail (PCR20) PCR as the location for the DRTM components measured by
+the kernel, e.g. external initrd image. This can be combined with storing
+the user authority in the PCR.DLME_Authority PCR to seal/attest to different
+variations of platform details/authorities and user details/authorities. An
+example of how this can be achieved was presented in the FOSDEM - 2021 talk
+"Secure Upgrades with DRTM".
+
+SHA-1 Usage
+-----------
+
+Secure Launch is written to be compliant with the Intel TXT Measured Launch
+Developer's Guide. The MLE Guide dictates that the system can be configured to
+use both the SHA-1 and SHA-2 hashing algorithms. The choice is dictated by the
+hash algorithm banks firmware enabled at system start time.
+
+Regardless of the preference towards SHA-2, if the firmware elected to start
+with the SHA-1 and SHA-2 banks active and the dynamic launch was configured to
+include SHA-1, Secure Launch is obligated to record measurements for all
+algorithms requested in the launch configuration. If SHA-1 can be disabled in
+the firmware setup, then TXT and Secure Launch will only use the SHA-2 banks
+while establishing the launch environment.
+
+Ultimately, the security of a RTM solution relies on how and what measurements are
+used to assess the health of a system. If SHA-1 measurements are made but not
+used, i.e. the attestation enforcement only uses SHA-2, then it has no impact
+on the security of the system.
+
+Finally, there are older systems with TPM 1.2 chips that only support SHA-1. If
+the system integrator (whether that be the OEM, employer, distro maintainer,
+system administrator, or end user) chooses to use older hardware that only has
+a TPM 1.2 chip, then they accept the risk it creates in their solution.
