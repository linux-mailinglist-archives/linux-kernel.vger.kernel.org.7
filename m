Yeah that's not ideal... Then keep it this way.

That's true, but it also wouldn't hurt to keep it for this patch and do
the change in a separate one. Or mention it in the commit message :)

`MiscDevice::open` could return an `impl PinInit<Self, Error>` :)

The rust_misc_device example would still work if we changed this to
`Self`. Now it's not a complicated user of the API and someone might
want to store `Self` in an `Arc` and then store that as the private
data, as the MiscDevice is also referenced from somewhere else. But I
don't know if that is common or an intended use-case :)

For simple use-cases however, I think that `Self` definitely is the
right choice (as opposed to `Pin<KBox<Self>>` for example, as that has
an extra allocation :)
