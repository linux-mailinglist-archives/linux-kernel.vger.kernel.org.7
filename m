Someone with time and the sc8280xp and x1e CRDs should be able to set
them up for booting from either UFS or SPI-NOR and see if that makes a
difference to confirm this.

So far my sc8280xp CRD with UFS fails, while Konrad's work with SPI-NOR
(NVMe).

My x1e CRD works but also boots from SPI-NOR (NVMe).

The Yoga C630 booting from UFS is also known to fail.

That's because there is a common kernel implementation used across a
host of fw implementations.

Here it's just Qualcomm doing something funny that affects their own
platforms. We should be able to figure this out without forcing users or
distros to pass command line parameters.

Do we know if there are any sc8280xp or x1e machines that boot off UFS?

If not (even with the exception of the CRDs) then it should be fine to
just whitelist the SoCs without any command line parameters.

Adding to a blacklist is bound to be overlooked, while adding to a
whitelist is not.

I'd rather see you get to the bottom of the UFS boot issue and whether
there is some way to determine this programmatically.

If everything that's currently upstream boots from NVMe that may not
necessarily mean it works for devices using UFS.

Good. We can manage with adding new entries for a while still while you
guys at Qualcomm work this out.
