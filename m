Agreed, it is a little difficult to consider all the cases ahead of
time. What is clear to me though is that [paused] can be inferred from
[count + enabled], and conversely [enabled] from [count + paused]. As a
result I really wouldn't store both paused and enabled in task_struct -
duplicating information is how you create inconsistent states.

We can very easily introduce helpers to get the enabled/paused status
regardless of how they're stored. Since "enabled" is what we need to
know in most cases (arch checking the status), I would rather store
"enabled" than "paused". But indeed, let's see how it turns out in practice.

This is a core expectation for lazy_mmu: when leave() is called, any
batched state is flushed. The fact it currently happens unconditionally
when calling leave() is in fact what stops nesting from exploding on
arm64 with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC [1].

I also wondered about that. I think the safest is to make them
respectively arch_leave() and arch_enter() - the flushing entailed by
arch_leave() might not be required, but it is safer. Additionally,
powerpc/sparc disable preemption while in lazy_mmu, so it seems like a
good idea to re-enable it while paused (by calling arch_leave()).
