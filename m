For some reason, my email (office365) rejected all these patches (not
even quarantined), I only got the replies. Anyway, I can get them from
the lore archive.

We'd need to reproduce these numbers on other platforms as well and with
different page sizes. I hope Ryan can do some tests next week.

Purely looking at the patch, I don't like the complexity. I'd rather go
with your v1 if the numbers are fairly similar (even if slightly slower).

However, I don't trust microbenchmarks like calling mlock() in a loop.
It was hand-crafted to dirty the whole buffer (making ptes young+dirty)
before mlock() to make the best out of the rewritten contpte_ptep_get().
Are there any real world workloads that would benefit from such change?

As it stands, I think this patch needs better justification.

Thanks.
