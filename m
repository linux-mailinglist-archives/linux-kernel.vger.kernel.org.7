Hi Thomas,

To help find a random inline assembly in your code, place comments
within the ASM block. Something like:

asm volatile(
  "# HEY! I'M RIGHT HERE\n\t"
  "syscall 0\n"
...

You can then search the assembly for that to see what's generated.

[+Ian because he also knows inline assembly]

This might be a Clang bug, as it's well known that Clang's support of
GCC's extended asm is lacking in key areas...especially with regards
to local register variables.

I'm not confident I completely understand the documentation Nathan
pointed out. It states that the only supported use is for input and
output to extended asm, but then goes on to show an example where they
initialize a variable. (??)

Looking at this a bit closer, the LLVM IR initially generated by the
front end is this for the "+r" version (it's verbose, but not to
worry):

 1. %in =3D alloca i64, align 8
 2. %out =3D alloca i64, align 8
 3. store i32 0, ptr %retval, align 4
 4. store i64 0, ptr %in, align 8, !dbg !19
 5. %0 =3D load i64, ptr %out, align 8, !dbg !26
 6. %1 =3D load i64, ptr %in, align 8, !dbg !27
 7. %2 =3D call i64 asm sideeffect "nop",
"=3D{eax},{eax},{eax},~{dirflag},~{fpsr},~{flags}"(i64 %1, i64 %0) #2,
!dbg !26
 8. store i64 %2, ptr %out, align 8, !dbg !26

Notice instructions (1), (2), (5), and (6). Instructions (1) and (2)
are simply a way for LLVM to indicate that these are variables and are
64-bits in size. The "%in" variable is assigned the value "0" (zero)
with the "store" in (4), but notice that "%out" never has a value
assigned to it. The assembly block indicated that it *should* have a
value, because of the '+' modifier. This means that once all of the
stores and loads are reduced by later passes the "%out" variable will
have an undefined value.

One could argue that it *does* have a value, because it's in the same
register as "%in", but LLVM's middle end doesn't work like that. It
only sees two variables, not that they're in the same register. So
that's what adds the 'undef' that Nathan pointed out.. In Clang terms,
"undef" can mean "undefined behavior" (like here) and may elide code
that exhibits it.

One way you could resolve this is to say that the "out" variable has
an early clobber:

  : "+&r"(out)

This tells the compiler that the value is written before being read.
Therefore, the compiler won't assume that it has no value.
