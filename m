Hi Pavel,
so for cpuidle part we've had commit ("38f83090f515 cpuidle: menu: Remove iowait influence")
for a while now without much complaints, hopefully that means it stays in.
So I'd really like to know how the results still compare for relevant workloads.

cpufreq iowait boosting is still a thing in schedutil and intel_pstate,
and so far I've failed to convince Rafael and Peter to get rid of it.
I still think that is the right thing to do, but it does come with a
regression in most of the simple synthetic fio tests.

Details would be appreciated, I looked the the postgres workload that
justified it initially and that was on cpuidle iowait which is no
longer a thing.

I'm not against $subject necessarily, it's clearly a hack tapering
over this but as I've mentioned I'm fine carrying a revert of $subject
for a future series on iowait boosting.

Ah thank you, I've missed this
https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/f548f142-d6f3-46d8-9c58-6cf595c968fb@kernel.dk/
Would be nice if this lead to more numbers comparing the two at least.
