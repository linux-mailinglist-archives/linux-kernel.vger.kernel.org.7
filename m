You still did not provide the detailed reason for it yet. I understand
you want the per cgroup swap device arbitrate ordering, that is a
solution not the root cause. I want to go one level deeper, why do you
want to have per cgroup swap device ordering. What is the
consideration to use the per cgroups list of the swap device order vs
other approach. For example, I want to preserve the fast swap device
mostly for jobs requiring fast response, I don't want to fill the fast
swap device with slow jobs' data. That is one of my guesses. Please
provide the background usage case and thinking process to get to that
conclusion.  Right now I am just guessing in the dark. You jump to the
conclusion of using aribitury cgroup swap device order as the only
solution too soon too quickly.

That is why we should make it a more formal proposal, list out the
details to solicit feedback.

Thank you. If you can integrate the swap.tiers into your next series,
that would be great. I am worried that I might not have enough time to
implement it myself. I can certainly reason about it and point you in
the right direction as best as I can.

The Priority is just the global swap file ordering. Higher priority
use that swap device first.

The idea of matching the faster swap with higher priority is just a
strategy to get better performance. It does not mean the priority =3D=3D
device speed.
If the user wants  to choose another priority strategy, maybe slower
performance, that is OK. They will get what they ask for.
We as  the kernel developer design the system as simply as possible to
achieve the good performance. Basically allow the good strategy to
happen easily. I wouldn't go overboard to change the meaning of
priority.

You touch on a very good point. How to mix the global order and the
per memcg order.

Yes, and no. We should allow the better performance strategy to happen
easily while maintaining the code complexity low. That is what I am
trying to do here.

Yes, if you put all the fast tier in one group. It needs to be
discussed case by case. That is exactly what I am asking for, what is
your usage case in mind that demands the per cgroup priority. We can
analyze the usage case and come up with creative solutions before we
jump to the conclusion. You can, for example, have divided the swap
space into two groups. A1 & A2 are both fast tiers. B1 & B2 are both
slow tiers. The one always follows to fill up A to B order using the
A1 and B1 group. The one wants to fill up the B first then A uses the
A2 and B2 group. 1 and 2 groups never mix. Then you can still maintain
LRU order when B2 fills up and starts to use A2, it will not upset the
A1 LRU because they are different swap devices on different groups.

If you give a more detailed usage situation, what challenge it faces.
I can give a more detailed solution using per cgroup priority vs
swap.tiers. That is why your usage case and reason is important.

Yes, if you keep them in one group and mix them. See the above 1 & 2

Why do you want to fill up the slower device first? You haven't
answered that question in detail. You are asking for a behavior
because you already determined you want this behavior. You need to go
deeper to the root cause why you want this behavior. What is your
ultimate goal? There might be other solutions addressing your ultimate
goal without using the behavior you choose.

You did not give me a reason why option 1) violates your goal. I feel
that your goal is already fixated on the swap order. That is only the
solution of your thought process. You haven't shown us how you come to
that conclusion.

Your series assumes adopting swap.tiers are likely to get in before
the vswap does. If that is the case, that problem is for vswap to
solve. Let's work on this incrementally one step at a time.

Exactly. We can start with this simple case and address the main
problem. If there is a special case we need to do the other order, we
can add them later. It makes sense to have a simple and clean solution
address the majority of the usage case first. The most common usage I
see is that, let latency sensitive jobs use faster tiers. Overflow to
a slower tier if necessary. The latency insensitive jobs just use the
slower tiers.

You are most welcome.
