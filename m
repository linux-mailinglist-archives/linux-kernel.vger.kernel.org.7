+Hybrid Automata
+===============
+
+Hybrid automata are an extension of deterministic automata, there are several
+definitions of hybrid automata in the literature. The adaptation implemented
+here is formally denoted by G and defined as a 7-tuple:
+
+        *G* = { *X*, *E*, *V*, *f*, x\ :subscript:`0`, X\ :subscript:`m`, *i* }
+
+- *X* is the set of states;
+- *E* is the finite set of events;
+- *V* is the finite set of environment variables;
+- x\ :subscript:`0` is the initial state;
+- X\ :subscript:`m` (subset of *X*) is the set of marked (or final) states.
+- *f* : *X* x *E* x *C(V)* -> *X* is the transition function.
+  It defines the state transition in the occurrence of an event from *E* in the
+  state *X*. Unlike deterministic automata, the transition function also
+  includes guards from the set of all possible constraints (defined as *C(V)*).
+  Guards can be true or false with the valuation of *V* when the event occurs,
+  and the transition is possible only when constraints are true. Similarly to
+  deterministic automata, the occurrence of the event in *E* in a state in *X*
+  has a deterministic next state from *X*, if the guard is true.
+- *i* : *X* -> *C(V)* is the invariant assignment function, this is a
+  constraint assigned to each state in *X*, every state in *X* must be left
+  before the invariant turns to false. We can omit the representation of
+  invariants whose value is true regardless of the valuation of *V*.
+
+The set of all possible constraints *C(V)* is defined according to the
+following grammar:
+
+        g = v < c | v > c | v <= c | v >= c | v == c | v != c | g && g | true
+
+With v a variable in *V* and c a numerical value.
+
+We define the special case of hybrid automata whose variables grow with uniform
+rates as timed automata. In this case, the variables are called clocks.
+As the name implies, timed automata can be used to describe real time.
+Additionally, clocks support another type of guard which always evaluates to true:
+
+        reset(v)
+
+The reset constraint is used to set the value of a clock to 0.
+
+It is important to note that any valid hybrid automaton is a valid
+deterministic automaton with additional guards and invariants. Those can only
+further constrain what transitions are valid but it is not possible to define
+transition functions starting from the same state in *X* and the same event in
+*E* but ending up in different states in *X* based on the valuation of *V*.
+
+Examples
+--------
+
+The 'wip' (wakeup in preemptive) example introduced as a deterministic automaton
+can also be described as:
+
+- *X* = { ``any_thread_running`` }
+- *E* = { ``sched_waking`` }
+- *V* = { ``preemptive`` }
+- x\ :subscript:`0` = ``any_thread_running``
+- X\ :subscript:`m` = {``any_thread_running``}
+- *f* =
+   - *f*\ (``any_thread_running``, ``sched_waking``, ``preemptive==0``) = ``any_thread_running``
+- *i* =
+   - *i*\ (``any_thread_running``) = ``true``
+
+Which can be represented graphically as::
+
+     |
+     |
+     v
+   #====================#   sched_waking;preemptive==0
+   H                    H ------------------------------+
+   H any_thread_running H                               |
+   H                    H <-----------------------------+
+   #====================#
+
+In this example, by using the preemptive state of the system as an environment
+variable, we can assert this constraint on ``sched_waking`` without requiring
+preemption events (as we would in a deterministic automaton), which can be
+useful in case those events are not available or not reliable on the system.
+
+Since all the invariants in *i* are true, we can omit them from the representation.
+
+As a sample timed automaton we can define 'stall' as:
+
+- *X* = { ``dequeued``, ``enqueued``, ``running``}
+- *E* = { ``enqueue``, ``dequeue``, ``switch_in``}
+- *V* = { ``clk`` }
+- x\ :subscript:`0` = ``dequeue``
+- X\ :subscript:`m` = {``dequeue``}
+- *f* =
+   - *f*\ (``enqueued``, ``switch_in``, ``clk < threshold``) = ``running``
+   - *f*\ (``running``, ``dequeue``) = ``dequeued``
+   - *f*\ (``dequeued``, ``enqueue``, ``reset(clk)``) = ``enqueued``
+- *i* = *omitted as all true*
+
+Graphically represented as::
+
+       |
+       |
+       v
+     #============================#
+     H          dequeued          H <+
+     #============================#  |
+       |                             |
+       | enqueue; reset(clk)         |
+       v                             |
+     +----------------------------+  |
+     |          enqueued          |  | dequeue
+     +----------------------------+  |
+       |                             |
+       | switch_in; clk < threshold  |
+       v                             |
+     +----------------------------+  |
+     |          running           | -+
+     +----------------------------+
+
+This model imposes that the time between when a task is enqueued (it becomes
+runnable) and when the task gets to run must be lower than a certain threshold.
+A failure in this model means that the task is starving.
+One problem in using guards on the edges in this case is that the model will
+not report a failure until the ``switch_in`` event occurs. This means that,
+according to the model, it is valid for the task never to run.
+As this is not exactly what is intended, we can change the model as:
+
+- *X* = { ``dequeued``, ``enqueued``, ``running``}
+- *E* = { ``enqueue``, ``dequeue``, ``switch_in``}
+- *V* = { ``clk`` }
+- x\ :subscript:`0` = ``dequeue``
+- X\ :subscript:`m` = {``dequeue``}
+- *f* =
+   - *f*\ (``enqueued``, ``switch_in``) = ``running``
+   - *f*\ (``running``, ``dequeue``) = ``dequeued``
+   - *f*\ (``dequeued``, ``enqueue``, ``reset(clk)``) = ``enqueued``
+- *i* =
+   - *i*\ (``enqueued``) = ``clk < threshold``
+
+Graphically::
+
+    |
+    |
+    v
+  #=========================#
+  H        dequeued         H <+
+  #=========================#  |
+    |                          |
+    | enqueue; reset(clk)      |
+    v                          |
+  +-------------------------+  |
+  |        enqueued         |  |
+  |    clk < threshold      |  | dequeue
+  +-------------------------+  |
+    |                          |
+    | switch_in                |
+    v                          |
+  +-------------------------+  |
+  |         running         | -+
+  +-------------------------+
+
+In this case, we moved the guard as an invariant to the ``enqueued`` state,
+this means we not only forbid the occurrence of ``switch_in`` when ``clk`` is
+past the threshold but also mark as invalid in case we are *still* in
+``enqueued`` after the threshold. This model is effectively in an invalid state
+as soon as a task is starving, rather than when the starving task finally runs.
+
+Hybrid Automaton in C
+---------------------
+
+The definition of hybrid automata in C is heavily based on the deterministic
+automata one. Specifically, we add the set of environment variables and the
+constraints (both guards on transitions and invariants on states) as follows::
+
+  /* enum representation of X (set of states) to be used as index */
+  enum states {
+	dequeued = 0,
+	enqueued,
+	running,
+	state_max
+  };
+
+  #define INVALID_STATE state_max
+
+  /* enum representation of E (set of events) to be used as index */
+  enum events {
+	dequeue = 0,
+	enqueue,
+	switch_in,
+	event_max
+  };
+
+  /* enum representation of V (set of environment variables) to be used as index */
+  enum envs {
+	clk = 0,
+	env_max,
+	env_max_stored = env_max
+  };
+
+  struct automaton {
+	char *state_names[state_max];                  // X: the set of states
+	char *event_names[event_max];                  // E: the finite set of events
+	char *env_names[env_max];                      // V: the finite set of env vars
+	unsigned char function[state_max][event_max];  // f: transition function
+	unsigned char initial_state;                   // x_0: the initial state
+	bool final_states[state_max];                  // X_m: the set of marked states
+  };
+
+  struct automaton aut = {
+	.state_names = {
+		"dequeued",
+		"enqueued",
+		"running"
+	},
+	.event_names = {
+		"dequeue",
+		"enqueue",
+		"switch_in"
+	},
+	.env_names = {
+		"clk"
+	},
+	.function = {
+		{ INVALID_STATE,      enqueued, INVALID_STATE },
+		{ INVALID_STATE, INVALID_STATE,       running },
+		{      dequeued, INVALID_STATE, INVALID_STATE },
+	},
+	.initial_state = dequeued,
+	.final_states = { 1, 0, 0 },
+  };
+
+  static bool verify_constraint(enum states curr_state, enum events event,
+				 enum states next_state)
+  {
+	bool res = true;
+
+	/* Validate guards as part of f */
+	if (curr_state == enqueued && event == sched_switch_in)
+		res = get_env(clk) < threshold;
+	else if (curr_state == dequeued && event == sched_wakeup)
+		reset_env(clk);
+
+	/* Validate invariants in i */
+	if (next_state == curr_state)
+		return res;
+	if (next_state == enqueued && res)
+		start_timer(clk, threshold);
+	else
+		cancel_timer();
+	return res;
+  }
+
+The function ``verify_constraint``, here reported as simplified, checks guards,
+performs resets and starts timers to validate invariants according to
+specification.
+Due to the complex nature of environment variables, the user needs to provide
+functions to get and reset environment variables, although we provide some
+helpers for common types (e.g. clocks with ns or jiffy granularity).
+Invariants defined in this way only make sense as clock expirations (e.g. *clk
+< threshold*).
+
+Graphviz .dot format
+--------------------
+
+Also the Graphviz representation of hybrid automata is an extension of the
+deterministic automata one. Specifically, guards can be provided in the event
+name separated by ``;``::
+
+    "state_start" -> "state_dest" [ label = "sched_waking;preemptible==0;reset(clk)" ];
+
+Invariant can be specified in the state label (not the node name!) separated by ``\n``::
+
+    "enqueued" [label = "enqueued\nclk < threshold_jiffies"];
+
+Constraints can be specified as valid C comparisons and allow spaces, the first
+element of the comparison must be the clock while the second is a numerical or
+parametrised value. Guards allow comparisons to be combined with boolean
+operations (``&&`` and ``||``), resets must be separated from other constraints.
+
+This is the full example of the last version of the 'stall' model in DOT::
+
+  digraph state_automaton {
+      {node [shape = circle] "enqueued"};
+      {node [shape = plaintext, style=invis, label=""] "__init_dequeued"};
+      {node [shape = doublecircle] "dequeued"};
+      {node [shape = circle] "running"};
+      "__init_dequeued" -> "dequeued";
+      "enqueued" [label = "enqueued\nclk < threshold_jiffies"];
+      "running" [label = "running"];
+      "dequeued" [label = "dequeued"];
+      "enqueued" -> "running" [ label = "switch_in" ];
+      "running" -> "dequeued" [ label = "dequeue" ];
+      "dequeued" -> "enqueued" [ label = "enqueue;reset(clk)" ];
+      { rank = min ;
+          "__init_dequeued";
+          "dequeued";
+      }
+  }

+rv/ha_monitor.h
++++++++++++++++
+
+The implementation of hybrid automaton monitors derives directly from the
+deterministic automaton one. Despite using a different header
+(``ha_monitor.h``) the functions to handle events are the same (e.g.
+``da_handle_event``).
+
+Additionally, the `rvgen` tool populates skeletons for the
+``ha_verify_constraint``, ``ha_get_env`` and ``ha_reset_env`` based on the
+monitor specification in the monitor source file.
+
+Unless the monitor relies on complex constraints, ``ha_verify_constraint``
+is typically ready as it is generated by `rvgen`:
+
+* standard constraints on edges are turned into the form::
+
+    res = ha_get_env(ha_mon, ENV) < VALUE;
+
+* reset constraints are turned into the form::
+
+    ha_reset_env(ha_mon, ENV);
+
+* constraints on the state are implemented using timers
+
+  - armed before entering the state
+
+  - cancelled while entering any other state
+
+  - untouched if the state does not change as a result of the event
+
+Constraint values can be specified in 3 forms:
+
+* literal value (with optional unit). E.g.::
+
+    preemptive == 0
+    clk < 100ns
+    threshold <= 10j
+
+* constant value (uppercase string). E.g.::
+
+    clk < MAX_NS
+
+* parameter (lowercase string). E.g.::
+
+    clk <= threshold_jiffies
+
+In all cases, `rvgen` will try to understand the type of the environment
+variable from the name or unit. For instance, constants or parameters
+terminating with `_NS` or `_jiffies` are intended as clocks with ns and jiffy
+granularity, respectively. Literals with measure unit `j` are jiffies and if a
+time unit is specified (`ns` to `s`), `rvgen` will convert the value to `ns`.
+
+Constants need to be defined by the user (but unlike the name, they don't
+necessarily need to be defined as constants). Parameters get converted to
+module parameters and the user needs to provide a default value.
+
+If `rvgen` determines that the variable is a clock, it provides the getter and
+resetter based on the unit. Otherwise, the user needs to provide an appropriate
+definition.
+Typically non-clock environment variables are not reset. In such case only the
+getter skeleton will be present in the file generated by `rvgen`.
+For instance, the getter for preemptive can be filled as::
+
+  static u64 ha_get_env(struct ha_monitor *ha_mon, enum envs env)
+  {
+      if (env == preemptible)
+          return preempt_count() == 0;
+      return ENV_INVALID_VALUE;
+  }
+
+The function is supplied the ``ha_mon`` parameter in case some storage is
+required (as it is for clocks), but environment variables without reset do not
+require a storage and can ignore that argument.
+The number of environment variables requiring a storage is limited by
+``MAX_HA_ENV_LEN``, however such limitation doesn't stand for other variables.
+
+Finally, constraints on states are only valid for clocks and only if the
+constraint is of the form `clk < N`. This is because such constraints are
+implemented with the expiration of a timer.
+Typically the clock variables are reset just before arming the timer, but this
+doesn't have to be the case and the available functions take care of it.
+It is a responsibility of per-task monitors to make sure no timer is left
+running when the task exits.
