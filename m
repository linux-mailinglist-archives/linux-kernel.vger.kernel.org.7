Thanks for the explanation and the analysis. I think we were looking at the
patch from different point of views: I was interested in not changing the
current behaviour, you were saying that the existing behaviour can be improved
upon.

I agree here, this looks on an improvement on existing behaviour. I would keep
it as a patch separate from this series, as it's not a fix, and it's not related
to to the rules from DEN0154.

Thanks,
