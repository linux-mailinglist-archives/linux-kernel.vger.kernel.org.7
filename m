In all cases that I'm aware of (platform code, DT, ACPI, etc), and as
far back as I can remember, the platform devices specify some predefined
data (IDs or strings) that is associated with (hard-coded directly into
the driver in fact) the driver it wishes to be bound to.  This
pre-defined identifier is stored in the driver's data structure:

struct device_driver {
        const char              	*name;
        const struct of_device_id       *of_match_table;
        const struct acpi_device_id     *acpi_match_table;
};

All of these are statically hard-coded items which a device can specify
in order to be bound to the driver.

I see.  Driver data is not compulsory.  There are plenty of drivers
which refrain from storing data for the child to make use of.

That's correct.  The compatible attribute is voluntary.
