Example not to follow but example to look and see that same block is
customized per SoC:

1. qcom,dwc3
2. rockchip,rk3328-dwc3

Quite different clock inputs, resets, interconnects and power-domains.

This feels (and looks inside) like not a SoC, but discouraged skeleton.

Still, drop the last and add one only for your ARC platform (s/_/-/).
Just name it after your platform, SoC or whatever you have there.
