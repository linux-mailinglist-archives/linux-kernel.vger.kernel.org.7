Okay. Then please make it more explicit in the commit message, "pll1_d8
seems to supply critical SoC components" describes the situation more
precisely than "Clock pll1_d8 got disabled, which resulted in a
non-functioning system".

I don't think this is an evidence strong enough to prove pll1_d8 itself
is critical.

pll1_d8 supplies not only pll1_d8_307p2 and its children, but also
pll1_d16_153p6, pll1_d24_102p4 and many more. It's totally possible that
not pll1_d8 but actually pll1_d16_153p6 or pll1_d24_102p4 is critical
for SoC operation: in a normal functioning system with a working UART,
these two clocks are always enabled since they (indirectly) supply UART
bus and func clocks, hidding the problem.

In your case, when DMA driver reverts the enable operation, the UART
driver don't seem to be probed yet (or enable count of pll1_d8 won't
decrease to zero). Disabling the parent may cause an SoC hang as well if
pll1_d16_153p6 or pll1_d24_102p4 is critcal in fact.

A correct enable count doesn't mean the hardware is configured
correctly.
