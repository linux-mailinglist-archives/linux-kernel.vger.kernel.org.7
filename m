The idea was to avoid as much as possible needing driver-side changes
depending on pKVM being present or not, to allow code re-use as much as
possible.

Right, if we implemented the release call properly in pKVM I'd be happy
with this patch, but I just don't think we should only do one half. We
either do it properly in pKVM or leave it with to the host -- the latter
feels simpler to me, but no strong opinions.

Thanks for the context. I'm still not convinced issueing the release
call in that way is fully correct, but happy to be corrected on my
understanding of the spec.
