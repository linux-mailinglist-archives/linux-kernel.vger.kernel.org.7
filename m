Yes, this is the reason behind the proposal I made here.
In this case the Kernel rejects a read that is requesting
a number of bytes cnt that is smaller than strlen(buf).

From a very quick look it seems that the read callback of event_hist_fops
is set to the standard seq_read, whereas the read callback in
ftrace_enable_fops defines its own method.
So maybe redesigning the read callback of event_hist_fops could
achieve this goal (in order to be sure I need to look deeper into it,
this is just a guess).

I think that from my side I do not have comprehensive answers to all your
questions (I need to read the code more in depth).
So to be pragmatic I can split this effort into two parts (documentation an=
d
redesign); I will propose documentation first with the TIPs that you mentio=
ned
above and later, if we find a better re-design solution, we can also amend
the documentation as needed.

Many thanks for your advice and directions
