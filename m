Hi Tony,

I'm still going through this, but here is my attempt to describe what equivalents arm has
in this area.

This is a shared memory area where an external agent (the OOBMSM) has logged measurement data?

Arm's equivalent to this is two things.
For things close to the CPU (e.g. stalls_llc_miss) these would be an PMU (possibly uncore
PMU) which follow a convention on their register layout meaning the general purpose pmu
driver should be able to drive them. The meaning of the events is described to user-space
via the perf json file. The kernel knows how to read event:6, but not what event:6 means.
The spec for this mentions MPAM, values can be monitored by ~RMID, but none of this is
managed by the MPAM driver.

The other thing arm has that is a bit like this is SCMI, which is a packet format for
talking to an on-die microcontroller to get platform specific temperature, voltage and
clock values. Again, this is another bit of kernel infrastructure that has its own way of
doing things. I don't see this filtering things by ~RMID ... but I guess its possible.
That can have shared memory areas (termed 'fast channels'). I think they are an array of
counter values, and something in the packet stream tells you which one is which.


Neither of these need picking up by the MPAM driver to expose via resctrl. But I'd like to
get that information across where possible so that user-space can be portable.

For the performance counters especially, on arm I'd be trying to get these values by
teaching perf about the CLOSID/RMID values, so that perf events are only incremented for
tasks in a particular control/monitor group.
(why that might be relevant is below)

Great!

Where do the package ids come from? How can user-space find out which CPUs are in package-0?

I don't see a package_id in either /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology or
Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-devices-system-cpu.

Looks good to me.

The difficulty MPAM platforms have had with mbm_total_bytes et al is the "starts counting
from the beginning of time" property. Having to enable mbm_total_bytes before it counts
would have allowed MPAM to report an error if it couldn't enable more than N counters at a
time. (ABMC suggests AMD platforms have a similar problem).


How do you feel about having to enable these before they start counting?

This would allow the MPAM driver to open the event via perf if it has a corresponding
feature/counter, then provide the value from perf via resctrl.


Another headache is how we describe the format of the contents of these files... a  made
up example: residency counts could be in absolute time, or percentages. I've been bitten
by the existing schemata strings being implicitly in a particular format, meaning
conversions have to happen. I'm not sure whether some architecture/platform would trip
over the same problem here.

(I hope there are only a few combinations!)

Huzzah! RISC-V has this property, and many MPAM platforms do, (...but not all...)

My thinking about this from a perf angle was to have named events for those things that
resctrl supports, but allow events to be specified by number, and funnel those through
resctrl_arch_rmid_read() so that the arch code can interpret them as a counter type-id or
an offset in some array. The idea was to allow platform specific counters to be read
without any kernel changes, reducing the pressure to add resctrl support for counters that
may only ever be present in a single platform.

With the XML data you have, would it be possible to add new 'events' to this interface via
sysfs/configfs? Or does too much depend on the data identified by that GUID...


Thanks,

James
