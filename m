Barry -- it would be great if you could re-run some of the benchmarks
from that commit with this fix applied.

Thanks, Ryan. I'll pick this as a fix, but perhaps the core code should
do this given that all the architectures selecting
ARCH_WANT_BATCHED_UNMAP_TLB_FLUSH now have an identical implementation
of arch_flush_tlb_batched_pending()?
