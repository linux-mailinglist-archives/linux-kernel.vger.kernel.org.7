Please don't do that. We don't have to fake a traceid for all sources.
It is only of use to the decoder, with manual input from the user. So,
someone using the TNOC based system must be aware of how to collect the
traceid and as such expose it from the TNOC and not all the other
sources connected to it.

Simply expose it on the TNOC device node
