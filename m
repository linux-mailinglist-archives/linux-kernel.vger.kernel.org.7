If there's any way to get these bindings and the dt change accepted.
Or getting the code change accepted without them. If there isn't, then
there's no reason for me to put any more effort into this series and I
need to start looking at alternatives. Like forking a downstream copy
of this driver for my Android efforts. I'm trying very hard to avoid
this as much as I can, though. The more downstream variation I have,
the more maintenance work I have to do over time.

I'm not even sure I can work around this by chainloading u-boot. With
some hoop jumping, I could read in the dt tables in u-boot, but I'm
not sure how simple it would be to write out a reserved memory table
to match what mainline currently expects. And I can't just replace the
entire boot stack due to secure boot.

The devices I'm talking about are not yet end of life, so it is
physically possible for them to get a bootloader update to conform to
the existing mainline model. But I'm just one guy trying to do 3rd
party support for these devices, I can't affect what Nvidia does with
the signed bootloader on these devices. I'd love to be able to swap
out an open source bootloader on these, but the secure boot setup
prevents that.

Like mentioned in the commit message for the 50k lines of dt
additions, the existing bootloader will only write the trained values
to dt nodes that already exist. If it doesn't find the nodes, it'll
still do the training, but nothing will be written to the in-ram copy
of the kernel dtb.

Sincerely,
Aaron
