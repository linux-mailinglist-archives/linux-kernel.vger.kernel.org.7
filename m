Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Fix several DTB validation issues
Date: Fri, 27 Jun 2025 17:16:19 +0200

This patch set to fix several DTB validation issues consists of 2 parts:
1) dsi refactoring
2) various low-hanging fruit

ad 1) The display/rockchip/rockchip,dw-mipi-dsi.yaml binding had:
- #address-cells
- #size-cells

My guess is that those properties were added for panel(s) which could
be connected. While convenient, it's not a property of the DSI
controller (in the SoC). And caused DTB validation issues when a panel
was not connected to the board. So add the #address/#size-cells
properties to the board dts[i] file where there is a panel and then
remove the properties from the SoC dtsi file ... and then from the
binding file as well.

Another part of the DSI refactoring had to do with the declaration of
endpoints in which various properties got redefined ... to the same
values they had in the SoC dsi node. The SoC dsi node already defined
the structure where each port got a label/phandle. That allows for a
simplification of the endpoint by referencing that label/phandle.

ad 2)
There were a number of issues which were obvious to me how to fix, so
I fixed those as well

My changes were based on yesterday's v6.17-armsoc/dts64 branch:
7f9509791507 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: add DTs for Firefly ROC-RK3588S-PC")

Then applied the following patches:
86491c2b99e5 ("dt-bindings: pinctrl: rockchip: increase max amount of device functions")
6f446bbe412a ("dt-bindings: gpu: mali-utgard: Add Rockchip RK3528 compatible")
ab9be0b75af5 ("dt-bindings: display: himax-hx8394: Add Huiling hl055fhav028c")
8358102806c6 ("dt-bindings: power: rockchip: Add support for RK3528")
233eda069994 ("dt-bindings: rockchip: pmu: Add compatible for RK3528")

And then validated it with W=1 using dtschema-2025.6.1.
The validation log file sizes:
- base: 99.8 KiB
- dsi: 82.1 KiB
- low-hanging-fruit: 68.9 KiB

I then checked whether dmesg wouldn't indicate problem on these boards:
- Rock64 (rk3328)
- RockPro64 (rk3399)
- PineTab2 (rk3566)

Even with removing timestamps there were quite some differences, but
that seems related to different boots (and thus the exact order in which
things are probed/configured. But I didn't spot difference due to this
patch set.

I don't have any px30 or rk3399-gru-* based boards, so I couldn't test
with those.


I also identified some other items which could reduce the DTB
validation 'noise' substantially:

"failed to match any schema with compatible" errors:

- 'mps,mp8859': regulator/mp8859.txt
- 'realtek,rt5651': sound/rt5651.txt
- 'rockchip,rk3368-mailbox': mailbox/rockchip-mailbox.txt
- 'rockchip,rk3399-gru-sound': sound/rockchip,rk3399-gru-sound.txt
- 'ti,tsc2007': input/touchscreen/tsc2007.txt

Other issues where a (small?) fix may help a lot:

px30:
- /isp@ff4a0000/ports: graph node has single child node 'port@0',
    #address-cells/#size-cells are not necessary
- /syscon@ff140000/lvds/ports/port@0: graph node has single child node
    'endpoint@0', #address-cells/#size-cells are not necessary
- /dsi@ff450000/ports/port@0: graph node has single child node
    'endpoint@0', #address-cells/#size-cells are not necessary

rk3399:
- /usb@fe800000: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property
- /usb@fe900000: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property

Cheers,
  Diederik
