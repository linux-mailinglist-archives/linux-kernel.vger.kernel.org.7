So I changed my mind, slightly.  I can still have the "order" parameter to
make the API cleaner (even if it'll be a pure overhead.. because all
existing caller will pass in PUD_SIZE as of now), but I think I'll still
stick with the ifdef in patch 4, as I mentioned here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/aFGMG3763eSv9l8b@x1.local/

The problem is I just noticed yet again that exporting
huge_mapping_get_va_aligned() for all configs doesn't make sense.  At least
it'll need something like this to make !MMU compile for VFIO, while this is
definitely some ugliness I also want to avoid..

===8<===

The issue is still mm_get_unmapped_area() is only exported on CONFIG_MMU,
so we need to special case that for huge_mapping_get_va_aligned(), and here
for !THP && !MMU.

Besides the ugliness, it's also about how to choose a default value to
return when mm_get_unmapped_area() isn't available.

I gave it a defalut value (0) as example, but I don't even thnk that 0
makes sense.  It would (if ever triggerable from any caller on !MMU) mean
it will return 0 directly to __get_unmapped_area() and further do_mmap()
(of !MMU code, which will come down from ksys_mmap_pgoff() of nommu.c) will
take that addr=0 to be the addr to mmap.. that sounds wrong.

There's just no way to provide a sane default value for !MMU.

So going one step back: huge_mapping_get_va_aligned() (or whatever name we
prefer) doesn't make sense to be exported always, but only when CONFIG_MMU.
It should follow the same way we treat mm_get_unmapped_area().

Here it also goes back to the question on why !MMU even support mmap():

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/nommu-mmap.txt

So, for the case of v4l driver (v4l2_m2m_get_unmapped_area that I used to
quote, which only defines in !MMU and I used to misread..), for example,
it's really a minimal mmap() support on ucLinux and that's all about that.
My gut feeling is the noMMU use case more or less abused the current
get_unmapped_area() hook to provide the physical addresses, so as to make
mmap() work even on ucLinux.

It's for sure not a proof that we should have huge_mapping_get_va_aligned()
or mm_get_unmapped_area() availalbe even for !MMU.  That's all about VAs
and that do not exist in !MMU as a concept.

Thanks,
