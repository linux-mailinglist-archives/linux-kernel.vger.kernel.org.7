Note there are 2 unrelated components in that patchset:
- one per-cpu instance of rss counters which is rolled up on context
switches, avoiding the costly counter alloc/free on mm
creation/teardown
- cpu iteration in get_mm_counter

The allocation problem is fixable without abandoning the counters, see
my other e -mail (tl;dr let mm's hanging out in slab caches *keep* the
counters). This aspect has to be solved anyway due to mm_alloc_cid().
Providing a way to sort it out covers *both* the rss counters and the
cid thing.

In your patchset the accuracy increase comes at the expense of walking
all CPUs every time, while a big part of the point of using percpu
counters is to have a good enough approximation somewhere that this is
not necessary.

Indeed the stock kernel fails to achieve that at the moment and as you
can see there is discussion how to tackle it. It is a general percpu
counter problem.

I verified get_mm_counter is issued in particular on mmap and munmap.
On high core count boxes (hundreds of cores) the mandatory all CPU
walk has to be a problem, especially if a given process is also highly
multi-threaded and mmap/munmap heavy.

Thus I think your patchset would also benefit from some form of
distribution of the counter other than just per-cpu and the one
centralized value. At the same time if RSS accuracy is your only
concern and you don't care about walking the CPUs, then you could
modify the current code to also do it.

Or to put it differently, while it may be changing the scheme to have
a local copy makes sense, the patchset is definitely not committable
in the proposed form -- it really wants to have better quality caching
of the state.
