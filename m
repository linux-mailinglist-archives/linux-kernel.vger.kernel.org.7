Maybe you could summarize the change here, something like:

"To fix it, when executing with RUID !=3D EUID or RGID !=3D EGID on a
non-set[ug]id transition, do not strip privileges such as ambient
capabilities and (if the execution is marked as unsafe) EUID/EGID
anymore; but keep marking such executions as secureexec."

Looks good to me overall, thanks for figuring out the history of this
not-particularly-easy-to-understand code and figuring out the right
fix.

Just a comment unrelated to this specific change:

Wow, nonroot_raised_pE() is hard to read, but I guess luckily it's
only used for auditing, so it's not that important...

The diff of the whole expression that decides whether to audit the
execution, reindented for clarity, looks like this:

(
  __cap_grew(effective, ambient, new) &&
  !(
    __cap_full(effective, new)
    &&
    (__is_eff(root, new) || __is_real(root, new))
    &&
    root_privileged()
  )
)
||
(
  root_privileged()
  &&
  __is_suid(root, new)
  &&
  !__cap_full(effective, new)
)
||
(
- !__is_setuid(new, old)
+ uid_eq(new->euid, old->euid)
  &&
  (
    (has_fcap && __cap_gained(permitted, new, old))
    ||
    __cap_gained(ambient, new, old)
  )
)

And we do auditing in three scenarios (situation with the patch applied):

1. We have effective caps that are not ambient caps, and we don't have
a full capability set based on having a root-privileged EUID or RUID.
2. We are in a suid-like execution but are not getting a full capability se=
t.
3. [changed part] We are not changing UID through a suid execution,
but either we gained ambient capabilities through the execution (???)
or we gained permitted capabilities while executing a file with fcaps.

I am highly confused by the __cap_gained(ambient, new, old) check
because I have no idea why ambient capabilities would ever increase on
exec. I thought they can only *decrease* on exec? Apparently that was
introduced in commit dbbbe1105ea6a ("capabilities: audit log other
surprising conditions").

Anyway, yeah, your change looks fine, just the preexisting code looks
dodgy to me.

Hm, so when we change from one EGID to another EGID which was already
in our groups list, we don't treat it as a privileged exec? Which is
okay because, while an unprivileged user would not just be allowed to
change their EGID to a GID from their groups list themselves through
__sys_setregid(), they would be allowed to create a new setgid binary
owned by a group from their groups list and then execute that?

That's fine with me, though it seems a little weird to me. setgid exec
is changing our creds and yet we're not treating it as a "real" setgid
execution because the execution is only granting privileges that
userspace could have gotten anyway.
