I am not sure this is a GICv5 only requirement (looking at SMMUv3,
for instance and there might be more IPs that require security
state awareness).

Or maybe it is a non-existing problem IIUC the paragraph below
correctly (albeit to be frank I don't understand how to determine
whether a dtb is consumed by eg secure-world-only).

"Note that it is still valid for bindings intended for purely Secure
world consumers (like kernels that run entirely in Secure) to simply
describe the view of Secure world using the standard bindings. These
secure- bindings only need to be used where both the Secure and Normal
world views need to be described in a single device tree."

I assume "standard bindings" there would mean that "reg" for the
GICv5 would be just eg "config frame" with no NS/S/Realm/Root attached.

We don't strictly need to have the same dts file for NS and S (example),
NS will never "need" the S bindings at least for GICv5.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
