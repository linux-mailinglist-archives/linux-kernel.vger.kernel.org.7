Similarly for uaccess.

I assume the host has a mechanism to check that the memory has been
marked as shared by the guest and the guest cannot claim it back as
private while the host is accessing it (I should dig out the CCA spec).

That's indeed problematic and we don't have a simple way to check that
a user VMM address won't fault when accessed via the linear map. The
vma checks we get with mmap are (host) page size based.

Can we instead only allow mismatched (or smaller) granule sizes in the
guest if the VMM doesn't use the mmap() interface? It's not like
trapping TCR_EL1 but simply rejecting such unaligned memory slots since
the host will need to check that the memory has indeed been shared. KVM
can advertise higher granules only, though the guest can ignore them.
