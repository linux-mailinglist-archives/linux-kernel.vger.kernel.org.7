tl;dr: I continue [3] to find it most intuitive for num_mbm_cntrs to be the exact
number of "active" RMIDs that the system can support *and* changing the name of
the modes to help user interpret num_mbm_cntrs: "mbm_cntr_event_assign" for ABMC,
"mbm_cntr_group_assign" for soft-ABMC.

details
-------

We are now back to the previous discussion about what user can expect from
the interface. Let me try and re-cap that discussion so that we can all hopefully
get back on the same page. Please add corrections/updates where needed.

soft-ABMC
---------
  soft-ABMC manages "active" (term TBD) RMID assignment to monitor groups. When an
  "active" RMID is assigned to a monitor group then *all* MBM events (not LLC occupancy)
  in that monitor group are counted. "Active" RMID assignment can be done per domain.

  Requirement: resctrl should accurately reflect which events are counted. That is,
  we do not want resctrl to pretend to allow user to assign an "active" RMID to
  only one event in a monitor group while all events are actually counted.

  Caveat: To support rapid re-assignment of RMIDs to monitor groups, llc_occupancy
  event is disabled when soft-ABMC is enabled.

ABMC
----
  ABMC manages (hardware) counter assignment to monitor group (RMID), event pairs.
  When a hardware counter is assigned to an RMID, event pair then only that
  RMID, event is counted. Hardware counter assignment can be done per domain.


shared assignment
-----------------
A shared assignment applies to both soft-ABMC and ABMC. A user can designate a
"counter" (could be hardware counter or "active" RMID) as shared and that means
the counter within that domain is shared between different monitor groups and actual
assignment is scheduled by resctrl.  


user interface
--------------

Next, consider the interface while keeping above definitions and requirements in mind.

This series introduces (using implementation, not cover-letter):

/sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs 
"num_mbm_cntrs":                                                               
	The maximum number of monitoring counters (total of available and assigned
	counters) in each domain when the system supports mbm_cntr_assign mode. 

/sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
"mbm_L3_assignments":                                                          
	This interface file is created when the mbm_cntr_assign mode is supported
	and shows the assignment status for each group.              

Consider "mbm_L3_assignments" first. The interface is documented for ABMC support
where it is possible to manage individual event assignment within monitor group.

For ABMC it is possible to assign just one event at a time and doing so consumes
one counter in that domain:

a) Starting state on system with 32 counters per domain, two events in default
   resource group consumes two counters in that domain:
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=30;1=32
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=_
mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=_

b) Assign counter to mbm_local_bytes in domain 1:
# echo "mbm_local_bytes:1=e" > /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=_
mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=30;1=31

The question is how this should look on soft-ABMC system. Let's say hypothetically
that on a soft-ABMC system it is possible to have 32 "active" RMIDs.

a) Starting state on system with 32 "active RMIDs" per domain, two events in default
   resource group consumes one RMID in that domain:

# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=_
mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=_

What should num_mbm_cntrs display?

Option A (counters are RMIDs):
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=31;1=32

Option B (pretend RMIDs are events):
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=62;1=64

b) Assign counter to mbm_local_bytes in domain 1:
# echo "mbm_local_bytes:1=e" > /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e

Note that even though user requested only mbm_local_bytes to be assigned, it
actually results in both mbm_total_bytes and mbm_local_bytes to be assigned. This
ensures accurate state representation to user space but this also creates an
inconsistent user interface between soft-ABMC and ABMC since user space intends
to use the same interface but "sometimes" assigning one event results in assign
of one event while "sometimes" it results in assign of multiple events.

wrt "num_mbm_cntrs"

Option A (counters are RMIDs):
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=31;1=31

Option B (pretend RMIDs are events):
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/info/L3_MON/num_mbm_cntrs
0=62;1=62 

Neither option seems ideal to me since the interface cannot be consistent
between ABMC and soft-ABMC.
As I mentioned in [2] it is not possible to hide ABMC and soft-ABMC behind
the same interface. When user space wants to monitor a particular monitor group
then it should be clear how that can be accomplished. Not knowing if
an assignment/unassignment to/from an event would impact one or all events
and whether it will consume one or multiple counters does not sound like a good
interface to me. 

As I understand current interface, user is required to know how ABMC and soft-ABMC
is implemented to be able to configure the system. For example, if user has file like:
	# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mbm_L3_assignments
	mbm_total_bytes:0=e;1=e
	mbm_local_bytes:0=e;1=e
user must know underlying implementation to be able to manage monitoring of
events and assigning counters otherwise it will be a surprise to lose monitoring
of all events when unassigning one event.

This is why I proposed in [3] that the name of the mode reflects how user can interact
with the system. Instead of one "mbm_cntr_assign" mode there can be "mbm_cntr_event_assign"
that is used for ABMC and "mbm_cntr_group_assign" that is used for soft-ABMC. The mode should
make it clear what the system is capable of wrt counter assignments.

Considering this the interface should be clear:
num_mbm_cntrs: reflects the number of counters in each domain that can be assigned. In
"mbm_cntr_event_assign" this will be the number of counters that can be assigned to 
each event within a monitoring group, in "mbm_cntr_group_assign" this will be the number
of counters that can be assigned to entire monitoring groups impacting all MBM events.

mbm_L3_assignments: manages the counter assignment in each group. When user knows the mode
is "mbm_cntr_event_assign"/"mbm_cntr_group_assign" then it should be clear to user space how the
interface behaves wrt assignment, no surprises of multiple events impacted when
assigning/unassigning single event.

For soft-ABMC I thus find it most intuitive for num_mbm_cntrs to be the exact number
of "active" RMIDs that the system can support *and* changing the name of the modes
to help user interpret num_mbm_cntrs.

This is about the:
	There's now more interest in Google for allowing explicit control of
	where RMIDs are assigned on Intel platforms. Even though the number of
	RMIDs implemented by hardware tends to be roughly the number of
	containers they want to support, they often still need to create
	containers when all RMIDs have already been allocated, which is not
	currently allowed. Once the container has been created and starts
	running, it's no longer possible to move its threads into a monitoring
	group whenever RMIDs should become available again, so it's important
	for resctrl to maintain an accurate task list for a container even
	when RMIDs are not available.

I see a monitor group as a collection of tasks that need to be monitored together.
The "task list" is the group of tasks that share a monitoring ID that
is required to be a valid ID since when any of the tasks are scheduled that ID is
written to the hardware. I intentionally tried to not use RMID since I believe
this is required for all archs.
I thus do not understand how a task can start running when it does not have
a valid monitoring ID. The idea of "deferred assignment" is not clear to me,
there can never be "unmonitored tasks", no? I think I am missing something here.
