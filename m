So WRT tracepoints, it's the same as a tree falling in the woods[1].

If a user space ABI "breaks" but no user space tooling notices, did it
really break?

The answer is "No".

As for tracepoints, its fine to change them until it's not ;-)

We had only one case that a tracepoint change broke user space where
Linus reverted that change [2]. That was because powertop hard coded
the addresses to the tracepoint field offsets and didn't use the format
files (what libtraceevent gives you). And I removed an unused common
field, which shifted everything and broke powertop.

But I converted powertop to use libtraceevent, waited a few year until
all the major distros provided the new powertop, and then I removed the
field. Guess what? Nobody noticed. (And old powertop would still break).

BPF taps into most tracepoints that change all the time. I'm cleaning
up unused tracepoints which included a couple that were left around to
"not break old BPF programs". I replied, if an old BPF program relies on
that tracepoint, keeping it around (but not used) is *worse* than
having that BPF program break. That's because that BPF program is
still broken (it's expecting that unused tracepoint to fire) but now
it's getting garbage for output (that being no output!). It's worse
because it's "silently failing" and the user may be relying on
something they don't know is broken.

So yeah, change the tracepoint when the code its tracing changes. That
way any tooling depending on it, knows that it can no longer depend on
it.

Anything using tracepoints are pretty much tied to the kernel anyway,
and when the kernel updates, the tooling that is relying on it also
needs to be updated otherwise it's not getting the information it is
expecting. That most definitely includes monitors.
