No worry, I'm the one who would like to apologize, for delayed response :)
I'm back from the travel, btw.

Thank you for sharing the details.  I wanted to better understand where the
issue happens and not, to clearly understand the root cause and make a proper
fix based on that.  I think we can now focusing on fixing it.

Thank you for the suggestion and testing, Quanmin!

I was thinking making the change for only i386 is right since I was mistakenly
thinking the issue happens only on i386.  Now it is clear I was wrong and we
have at least two cases.  And I agree your suggestion will fix both cases.

But I'm bit concerned i386 and arm might not all the case, so wannt make the
fix more generalized.  My understanding of the problem, which is enlightened
thanks to you, is that not every config supports dividing 64 bit with 32 bit.
And div_u64() is suggested in general for dividing 64 bit with 32 bit.  So,
what about making the if condition more general but specific to the root cause,
like below?

static unsigned long damon_pa_core_addr(
               phys_addr_t pa, unsigned long addr_unit)
{
       /*
        * Use div_u64() for avoiding linking errors related with __udivdi3,
        * __aeabi_uldivmod, or similar problems.  This should also improve the
        * performance optimization (read div_u64() comment for the detail).
        */
       if (sizeof(pa) == 8 && sizeof(addr_unit) == 4)
               return div_u64(pa, addr_unit);
       return pa / addr_unit;
}

Because the sizeof() result can be known at compile time, I think it shouldn't
cause the linking time error, and I confirmed that by passing the i386 test
case that kernel test robot shared.

Could I ask your opinion, Quanmin?  If you think that works, I could post v3 of
this patch series with the above fix.


Thanks,
SJ
