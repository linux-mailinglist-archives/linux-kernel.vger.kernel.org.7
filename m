AFAICS, wb_split_bdi_pages() will only be invoked in the sync scenarios, 
and not in the background writeback scenarios - which is exactly the 
case here.

And I noticed that there's something similar in background writeback, 
where writeback_chunk_size() will split all pages into several chunks, 
the min chunk size is 1024(MIN_WRITEBACK_PAGES) pages. The difference 
from wb_split_bdi_pages() is that we don't report progress after 
finishing the writeback of a chunk.

Yeah it still takes a long time, I checked the write_bandwidth and 
avg_write_bandwidth when warning was triggered:

	>>> wb.write_bandwidth
	(unsigned long)24
	>>> wb.avg_write_bandwidth
	(unsigned long)24
	>>> wb.write_bandwidth
	(unsigned long)13
	>>> wb.write_bandwidth
	(unsigned long)13

At this bandwidth, it will still takes a lot of seconds to write back 
MIN_WRITEBACK_PAGES pages.

So it might be a solution, but given the fact that the current minimum 
chunk size (1024) has been in place for over ten years, and that making 
it smaller would probably have a negative impact on performance. I'm 
afraid the filesystem maintainers will not accept this change.
If we donâ€™t modify this part but can report progress after finishing the 
chunk writeback, it should probably eliminate most of the unexpected 
warnings.

Yeah, exactly. What I mean is report progress within the whole writeback 
work, either writeback_sb_inodes() or do_writepages() is ok.

Thanks for clarification. So how about the following solution?

Instead of waking up all waiting threads every half second, we only wake 
them up if the writeback work lasts for the value of 
sysctl_hung_task_timeout_secs / 2 seconds to reduce possible overhead.

Hi, Jan, Christian, how do you think about it?

Please correct me if there's anything I'm missing or misunderstanding.

Thanks,
