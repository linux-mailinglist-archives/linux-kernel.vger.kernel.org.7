That was what I did and precisely what was causing the problem. We
have sys.h defining select() with fd_set in it with sys/select not yet
being included. I moved sys.h after all sys/* and it broke something
else instead.

Yeah I totally agree with you on that!

In an ideal world we'd have all sys/* *before* anything else. But I
do remember that we faced a few issues doing this. This can be refined
though. I'm just careful because we have not been annoyed in a while,
so I suspect we're close to something good and it's easy to cause more
breakage than fixes by touching all of this.

That's what I did in the end. We're just addressing annoying build
issues and not providing new stuff that deserves a full reorganization!
