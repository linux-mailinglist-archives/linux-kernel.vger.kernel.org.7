This problem can be solved by releasing the 'mod_map' resource when the 
module is unloaded. Freeing up these resources is just an address that 
cannot be translated into symbols, and there are no worse consequences.

I don't think it's necessary to introduce logic to restrict module 
unloading here, which doesn't bring benefits but increases the cost of 
interpretation for maintainers.

We can't ask users to know such specialized details of the 
implementation, which are unclear even to developers unfamiliar with the 
ftrace module. Users can accept planned reboot system recovery, but 
should not accept casual operations and the system crashes.All we can do 
is do a good job of protection, give users more tolerance.Perhaps a 
system that is dead but won't lie down is also a very undesirable 
situation.However, ftrace is used to collect information and locate 
faults. Even if it does not work, it does not affect services.In the 
production environment, the most afraid of using ftrace suddenly crashes 
the system.Therefore, the robustness of the tool itself is very important.

I reworked the two patches, and the changes to the existing process 
should be minimal. I don't know if I can get your approval. If you 
agree, I'll post another V3 version.
