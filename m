I don't think we *need* two caps; I was suggesting to consider both of these
conditions for the single cap. You are suggesting to separate them. But I think
both approaches give the same result?

I'm easy either way, but keen to understand why 2 caps are preferred?

Perhaps for my version it would be better to refer to it as
ARM64_CPUCAP_BOOT_RESTRICTED_CPU_LOCAL_FEATURE instead of
ARM64_CPUCAP_LOCAL_CPU_ERRATUM (they both have the exact same semantics under
the hood AFAICT).
