Yeah, I'm confused here as well.  In v1, there were 3 patches that were
marked as "Fixes" for a previous patch in the series.  In v2, no Fixes
were marked at all, BUT the patches were still in the series.

So what went wrong?  Was the v2 version of the original patch changed so
that the 3 other ones were not needed somehow?  If so, why were they in
the list again?

Anyway, I'm confused...

Please send a v3 of this series, NOT in response to any email thread so
that b4 does NOT get confused in any way, and I'll be glad to review
them and apply them to the proper branch after -rc1 is out next week or
so.

And document the heck out of what has changed in the series in the
different patches please.

thanks,

greg k-h
