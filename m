Hello Miguel,


Oh gotcha, yeah b4 inputted the correct To: and CC:, I just moved that 
all to CC: and directed the patch to Linus since this was a bug fix. It 
seems the regular flow still applies. Sorry about that!

Whoops! I didn't realize that's what that meant, was just wanting to 
give you both credit for that. Thanks!

Ah, I see. Usually b4 likes doing a cover letter, and for single patches 
it appends that in the commit itself. I'll keep that in mind moving 
forward. And thanks for letting me know about the tags! It seems like b4 
generated that, so I'll manually separate that from now on

Ah gotcha, I'll keep that in mind!

This does, thanks! I'll drop this patch for now then and will assume 
that Naresh will eventually send it. I was hoping to get this in by the 
stable release that is set to happen during the weekend (doesn't excuse 
my sloppiness though, sorry about that once again)

Anyways, thanks for being patient with me as I learn. :)


Thanks,

Rudraksha
