It'd be an improvement. Not sure if it'd solve the problem entirely.

Ok. But continuing along this line of reasoning, I'd conclude that it
would be even more useful to fail the path in device-mapper directly
after a failed IO request (given that we find an agreeable way to do
this, see below). Qemu could then retry, depending on the error code.
Paths would be failed one after the other, and eventually a PG failover
would occur.

As I wrote in my reply to Mikulas already, my understanding was that
Christoph's main objection was against retrying SG_IO ioctls in the
kernel on different paths, not against inspecting the error code.

This doesn't sound too promising IMO.

If we want to find a solution that's focused on user space, I'd suggest
to use multipathd rather than additional ioctls. After all, all
necessary information is available in multipathd.

Already today, qemu can use the multipath socket to query the current
state of paths in a map. I can imagine a new multipathd CLI command
that would instruct multipathd to check all paths of a given map
immediately (@Ben: set pp->tick to 1 for all paths of the map). This
command could be sent to multipathd in case of a suspected path
failure. This would have similar semantics as the
DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS_CMD ioctl, with some advantages, as it would take
the multipath configuration of the specific storage array into account.
It'd also avoid blocking qemu. multipathd would allow this command for
non-root connections, but to avoid DoS, accept it only once every N
seconds.

For regular block IO, the "path error" logic is in blk_path_error() [1]
and scsi_result_to_blk_status() [2]. blk_path_error() can be called
from dm; the problem in the SG_IO code path is that we don't have a
blk_status_t to examine. Therefore, in my old code, I replicated the
logic of scsi_result_to_blk_status() in the dm layer. It works, but
it's admittedly not the cleanest possible approach. OTOH, SG_IO on dm
devices isn't the cleanest thing to do in general ;-)

It didn't occur to me back then that we could fail paths without
retrying in the kernel.

Perhaps we could have the sg driver pass the blk_status_t (which is
available on the sg level) to device mapper somehow in the sg_io_hdr
structure? That way we could entirely avoid the layering violation
between SCSI and dm. Not sure if that would be acceptible to Christoph,
as blk_status_t is supposed to be exclusive to the kernel. Can we find
a way to make sure it's passed to DM, but not to user space?

Alternatively (if maintainers strictly object the error code inspection
by dm), I wonder whether we could just _always_ fail the current path
in case of errors in the dm-mpath SG_IO code path, without inspecting
the error code. Rationale: a) most potential error conditions are
treated as "path error" in block IO code path, b) qemu can still
inspect the error code and avoid retrying for errors that aren't path
errors, and c) if multipathd is running and the path has been failed
mistakenly, it will reinstate that path after just a few seconds. In
the worst case, an unintentional failover would occur. That isn't as
bad as it used to be, as active-passive configurations with explicit
TPGS are less common then in the past.

I don't think so. Do you have anything specific in mind?

See the paragraph about multipathd above.

PS: Yet another option that Christoph has suggested in the past would
be to move away from qemu's "scsi-block", and use the generic block
reservation mechanism to allow passthrough of reservation commands from
VMs to the host. Nobody seems to have explored this option seriously so
far.
