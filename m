It's not just about the TEE driver but rather if the TEE implementation
(a trusted OS) to whom the page is registered with. We don't want the
trusted OS to work on registered kernel pages if they gets free somehow
in the TEE client driver. Having a reference in the TEE subsystem
assured us that won't happen. But if you say slab allocations are still
prone the kernel pages getting freed even after refcount then can you
suggest how should we handle this better?

As otherwise it can cause very hard to debug problems if trusted OS can
manipulate kernel pages that are no longer available.

If we don't have a sane way to refcont registered kernel pages in TEE
subsystem then yeah we have to solely rely on the client drivers to
behave properly. Nevertheless, it's still within the kernel boundaries
which we can rely upon.
