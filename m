No need to be sorry :-)

(late? Less then 2 days vs my ~4 months before the git bisect ...)

I didn't know that, thanks.

My first (uneducated) hunch was a timing issue and ``=3Dm`` can reveal
issues which you wouldn't see with ``=3Dy``.
Andy already found an issue "that shouldn't happen" and my latest test
also had an unexpected result. So (eventually) we'll figure it out :-)

I think it would be beneficial if you'd do the tests that Andy asked
'me' to do too, so we can compare results.
FWIW: I have the 4GB RAM version.

Cheers,
