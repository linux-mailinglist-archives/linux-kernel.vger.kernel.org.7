Hi Krzysztof,

Thanks for the review.

Will fix this in next version. Thanks

I will refine the first two paragraphs to be very concise.

This section is important as it clarifies the difference between AM62a 
and AM62d, as we are reusing AM62a dtsi files for AM62d. Let me know if 
you need a shorter version.

Yep there were some indentation problems earlier, which is fixed in this 
version. There was also an ack from Conor Dooley in v3. I will include that.
