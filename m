I don't see much relation of carve-outs with Gstreamer or it's pending 
downstream patches. The memory is mainly managed from firmwares (mainly 
openvx layer being used underneath) and there are even non-gstreamer 
pure openvx based use-cases/tests which use these carveouts. At the end 
of the day, the firmwares from the only SDK which is released publicly 
for AM62A uses all these carveouts.

Yes as I said if whole firmware arch is getting updated then better to 
wait. I think probably the firmware team marked in cc can comment on 
that. Moreover I don't see any point of adding only half the regions as 
that would anyway not work with SDK supplied firmwares, for e.g. 
RTOS-to-RTOS ipc test run by firmwares on bootup would fail, along with 
other camera+ISP and AI use-cases.
