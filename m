Sorry, I didn't intend to  break streaming allocation's semantics.
A precise definition of streaming allocation is not found in the
existing code, documentation, or historical records. Consequently,
my previous understanding of it was somewhat inaccurate.

I previously thought it was used to optimize the efficiency of linear
traversal. For instance, if 500 inodes are created in group 0 and each
file is sequentially filled to 1GB, each file's goal, being empty, would
be group 1 (the second group in the inode's flex_bg).

Without a global goal and in the absence of non-linear traversal,
after the first inode is filled, the second inode would need to traverse
groups 1 through 8 to find its first free block.

This inefficiency escalates, eventually requiring the 500th inode to
potentially traverse almost 4000 block groups to find its first available
block.

I initially believed it could be split to the inode level to reduce
traversal time and file fragmentation. However, as you pointed out,
its purpose is to cluster large files, not data blocks within a file.
Given this, splitting it to the inode level no longer makes sense.

As mentioned above, it can also greatly improve the efficiency of linear
traversal, so we can't simply remove it.

Yes, since it's just a hint, we don't need a lock at all, not even
fe_start, we just need the last fe_group.

Spot on! We did try a single, lockless atomic64 variable, and just as
you pointed out, all processes started traversing from the very same
group, which just cranked up the contention, dropping OPS to just 6745.

That's a brilliant idea, actually!

Since most containers are CPU-pinned, this would naturally cluster a single
container's data blocks together. I believe we can also apply this to inode
allocation, so a container's inodes and data are all in a single region,
significantly reducing interference between containers.

My gratitude for your valuable suggestion!
I'm going to try out the CPU bucketing approach.
