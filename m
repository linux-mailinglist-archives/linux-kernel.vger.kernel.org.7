Mostly like for normal folios, for instance rmap when doing migrate. I think it would make
common code more messy if not done that way but sure possible. 
And not consuming pfns (address space) at all would have benefits.

Yes not present by CPU but mm has bookkeeping on them. The private page has no content
someone could change while in device, it's just pfn.
