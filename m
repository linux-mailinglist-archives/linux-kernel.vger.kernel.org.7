How about this in the header:

#define DECLARE_DUMP_AREA_FUNC(subsys, symbol) \

void subsys ## _get_ ## symbol ##_area(void **start, size_t *size);



#define DEFINE_DUMP_AREA_FUNC(subsys, symbol) \

void subsys ## _get_ ## symbol ##_area(void **start, size_t *size)\

{\

        *start = &symbol;\

        *size = sizeof(symbol);\

}


then, in sched just

DECLARE_DUMP_AREA_FUNC(sched, runqueues);

DEFINE_DUMP_AREA_FUNC(sched, runqueues);

or a single macro that wraps both.

would make it shorter and neater.

What do you think ?
