As part of a larger effort to bring various PowerPC-related bindings
into the YAML world, this patch converts msi-pic.txt to YAML and moves
it into the bindings/interrupt-controller/ directory. The conversion may
necessarily be a bit hard to read because the binding is quite verbose.

Changes in v2:
- Rebase on v6.16-rc1
- Address Conor Dooley's review comments:
  - Add multiline marker (|) to preserve formatting
  - Split 'reg' list in second example
  - Rewrite version dependent information as an if/else schema

+title: Freescale MSI interrupt controller
+
+description: |
+  The Freescale hypervisor and msi-address-64
+  -------------------------------------------
+
+  Normally, PCI devices have access to all of CCSR via an ATMU mapping.  The
+  Freescale MSI driver calculates the address of MSIIR (in the MSI register
+  block) and sets that address as the MSI message address.
+
+  In a virtualized environment, the hypervisor may need to create an IOMMU
+  mapping for MSIIR.  The Freescale ePAPR hypervisor has this requirement
+  because of hardware limitations of the Peripheral Access Management Unit
+  (PAMU), which is currently the only IOMMU that the hypervisor supports.
+  The ATMU is programmed with the guest physical address, and the PAMU
+  intercepts transactions and reroutes them to the true physical address.
+
+  In the PAMU, each PCI controller is given only one primary window.  The
+  PAMU restricts DMA operations so that they can only occur within a window.
+  Because PCI devices must be able to DMA to memory, the primary window must
+  be used to cover all of the guest's memory space.
+
+  PAMU primary windows can be divided into 256 subwindows, and each
+  subwindow can have its own address mapping ("guest physical" to "true
+  physical").  However, each subwindow has to have the same alignment, which
+  means they cannot be located at just any address.  Because of these
+  restrictions, it is usually impossible to create a 4KB subwindow that
+  covers MSIIR where it's normally located.
+
+  Therefore, the hypervisor has to create a subwindow inside the same
+  primary window used for memory, but mapped to the MSIR block (where MSIIR
+  lives).  The first subwindow after the end of guest memory is used for
+  this.  The address specified in the msi-address-64 property is the PCI
+  address of MSIIR.  The hypervisor configures the PAMU to map that address to
+  the true physical address of MSIIR.

-  etc.) and the second is "fsl,mpic-msi" or "fsl,ipic-msi" or
-  "fsl,mpic-msi-v4.3" depending on the parent type and version. If mpic
-  version is 4.3, the number of MSI registers is increased to 16, MSIIR1 is

-  should be used. The first entry is optional; the second entry is
-  required.
-
-- reg : It may contain one or two regions. The first region should contain
-  the address and the length of the shared message interrupt register set.
-  The second region should contain the address of aliased MSIIR or MSIIR1
-  register for platforms that have such an alias, if using MSIIR1, the second
-  region must be added because different MSI group has different MSIIR1 offset.
-

-
-Optional properties:
-- msi-available-ranges: use <start count> style section to define which

-  optional, without this, all the MSI interrupts can be used.
-  Each available range must begin and end on a multiple of 32 (i.e.

-The Freescale hypervisor and msi-address-64
--------------------------------------------
-Normally, PCI devices have access to all of CCSR via an ATMU mapping.  The
-Freescale MSI driver calculates the address of MSIIR (in the MSI register
-block) and sets that address as the MSI message address.
-
-In a virtualized environment, the hypervisor may need to create an IOMMU
-mapping for MSIIR.  The Freescale ePAPR hypervisor has this requirement
-because of hardware limitations of the Peripheral Access Management Unit
-(PAMU), which is currently the only IOMMU that the hypervisor supports.
-The ATMU is programmed with the guest physical address, and the PAMU
-intercepts transactions and reroutes them to the true physical address.
-
-In the PAMU, each PCI controller is given only one primary window.  The
-PAMU restricts DMA operations so that they can only occur within a window.
-Because PCI devices must be able to DMA to memory, the primary window must
-be used to cover all of the guest's memory space.
-
-PAMU primary windows can be divided into 256 subwindows, and each
-subwindow can have its own address mapping ("guest physical" to "true

-means they cannot be located at just any address.  Because of these

-
-Therefore, the hypervisor has to create a subwindow inside the same
-primary window used for memory, but mapped to the MSIR block (where MSIIR

-this.  The address specified in the msi-address-64 property is the PCI
-address of MSIIR.  The hypervisor configures the PAMU to map that address to
