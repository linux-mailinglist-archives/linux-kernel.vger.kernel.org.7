It's true that successfully acquiring the goal on retry is possible, but
the probability is too low; I think attempting the inode goal on retry is
not very meaningful. The lack of trylock logic in ext4_mb_find_by_goal()
also introduces some performance overhead.

Additionally, since preallocations might be dropped before retrying, the
inode's preallocation could also be discarded. Therefore, pa overlap needs
to be re-adjusted.

For data block allocation, we should call ext4_mb_normalize_request() to
regenerate a new ac_g_ex instead of directly resetting the original goal.
ext4_mb_normalize_request() will also determine whether to reset
EXT4_MB_HINT_TRY_GOAL.

For metadata block allocation, EXT4_MB_STREAM_ALLOC is not set, so there's
no need to worry about EXT4_MB_HINT_TRY_GOAL being cleared.

Clearing EXT4_MB_HINT_TRY_GOAL here is only to avoid inode goal allocation
with -1. If you insist that we should attempt the inode goal on retry,
I will send a separate patch to address that.


Cheers,
Baokun
