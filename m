At the interface level, I think mbm_L3_assignments on a non-ABMC
system would only need to contain a single line:

0=3Ds;1=3Ds;...;31=3Ds

But maybe for consistency we would synthesize a single, unmodifiable
counter configuration to reflect that allocating an RMID in a domain
results in assignment to all events and deallocating the RMID
unassigns all events. We could call it "group" to say it's assigning
at the group level, or perhaps just '*':

*:0=3Ds;1=3Ds;...;31=3Ds

I'm not sure about allowing a '*' on ABMC hardware, because it could
be interpreted as allocating a lot of counters when a large number of
event configurations exist.

*:0=3Ds;1=3Ds;...;31=3Ds
