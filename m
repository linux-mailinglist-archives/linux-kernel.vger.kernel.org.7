Having a separate DT overlay is perfectly fine if we want to
describe a board absolutely correctly: if the fan actually isn't
present, the operating system shouldn't be made to think it is
there, especially if there's no fan RPM feedback, which is the
case on almost all Rockchip boards that support a fan.

Preventing the kernel from managing a non-existent fan might even
save some CPU cycles, ending up producing a bit less heat, which
can only help in passively cooled setups.

However, the practice so far has been to describe the fans in the
main board dts files, if the board provides fan support, regardless
of the fan being present in a particular board setup or not.

We're safe, a thermal runaway isn't going to happen when the fan is
defined in a board DT but actually isn't present.  Thermal CPU and
GPU throttling will prevent the overheating from happening.

Yes, that's an option.  However, that in general doesn't resolve
the issues arising from systemd-boot users wanting to apply more
than a single DT overlay.

After thinking a bit about it, I'd support the extraction of fan
definitions into separate DT overlays.  As I wrote above already,
not managing the non-existent fan might actually help a bit with
passively cooled board setups, which is a good enough reason for
me to support separate DT overlays.

If we end up agreeing to accept this DT overlay, I'll have some
comments on the way cooling maps are defined.  I think there's
quite a bit of redundancy there.
