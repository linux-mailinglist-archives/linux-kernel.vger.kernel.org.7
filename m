This response sounds like we may have a different understanding of what "keep"
means.

Earlier versions of this patch series introduced a keep() method for both
debugfs::File and debugfs::Dir, which would consume, and hence get rid of, the
instance of a debugfs::File or a debugfs::Dir object, while *keeping* the
corresponding directory / file in the filesystem.

This makes it easy for a driver to leak the directory / file in the filesystem,
as explained in [1], which you seemed to agree with in [2].

Was this a misunderstanding?

This is promoting a C pattern (which for C code obviously makes a lot of sense),
i.e. we have a function that creates a thing and another function that removes
the thing given a handle of the created thing. Whether the handle is valid is
the responsibility of the caller.

In this case the handle would be the filename. For instance:

	debugfs_create_file("foo", parent, ...);
	debugfs_remove(debugfs_lookup("foo", parent));

This leaves room to the caller for making mistakes, e.g. if the caller makes a
typo in the filename. In this case we wouldn't even recognize it from the return
value, since there is none.

In Rust, we do things differently, i.e. we wrap things into an object that
cleans up itself, once it goes out of scope. For instance:

	let file = debugfs::File::new("foo", parent);

Subsequently we store file in a structure that represents the time we want this
file to exist. Once it goes out of scope, it's removed automatically.

This is better, since we can't make any mistakes anymore, i.e. we can't mess up
the filename or pass the wrong parent to clean things up.

Depending on whether the above was a misunderstanding and depending on how you
think about it with this rationale, I have quite some more reasons why we don't
want to have files / directories around in the filesystem without a
corresponding object representation in Rust.

But before I write up a lot more text, I'd like to see if we're not already on
the same page. :-)
