The race I am concerned about is between SU values represented in DAPM and actual values propagated inside the SDCA device. There could be a delay between writing a GE register and the SU register values changing.

The SDCA spec is supposed to describe what's physically connected, so when we parse the DisCo descriptors we should only see the level that is typically present in machine drivers. The codec descriptors are not generic at all, they should only describe a specific way of how a SDCA codec is used. The traditional split between codec and machine drivers does not really apply for SDCA, the SDCA descriptors represent the *machine* already.

I bet we'll revisit this multiple times :-)
