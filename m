Thank you for your detailed and kind explanation, Hugh!

I agree all your points.

I'd prefer the smaller source file following your suggested change below (using
pmd_trans_huge_lock()) in long term.  But, for a short term, I'd prefer the
smaller fix (dropping walk->action = ACTION_AGAIN) since it should also be
merged into stable@, up to 6.5.y.

So, I'd like to suggest as following.  Let's drop the
'walk->action = ACTION_AGAIN' like the below attached one, for now.  After it
is confirmed to fix the issue and merged into relevant trees including stable
trees, let's revisit the code to cleanup following pmd_trans_huge_lock()
pattern.

Please let me know if I'm missing something, or you have other opinions.

Xinyu, could you please test if the below attached patch fixes your issue and
let us know the result?

If Xinyu confirms the validity of the fix and no one objects to the above plan,
I will post the fix as a formal one with a better commit message.


Thanks,
SJ
