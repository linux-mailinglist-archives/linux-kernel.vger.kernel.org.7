I am not sure I understand what you mean by =E2=80=9Cdynamic use =
cases=E2=80=9D.

Can you expand a bit on that?

Dynamic is just "Regulator" in the current version of this patch. There =
is no
"Disabled" because there is no guarantee that someone else won't enable =
the
regulator, trivially breaking this invariant at any moment.

The only thing we can guarantee is "Enabled", through our own call to
"regulator_enable()".

In fact, for the typestate solution, I was thinking about "UnknownState" =
and
"Enabled", or any nomenclature along these lines.

Why not =E2=80=9Cenable()=E2=80=9D as we currently have?

If we go with the "Dynamic" nomenclature, and we agree that there's no
"Disabled",  then we can implement "pub fn enable(self) -> =
Regulator<Enabled>",
for "Dynamic", which is what we currently have, but with other names.

Also, I personally dislike this term: it's hard to tell what =
Regulator<Dynamic>
means on a first glance.

This is already how it works: Regulator is the default and =
EnabledRegulator
adds an extra invariant.

Yeah, I agree.

That is true.
