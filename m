OK, we will update the volume control to:
SOC_DOUBLE_TLV(...)
and use the regmap to cache the volumes.

OK.

Yes, the volume will be set to the default value at the first time of initialization on probe,
and it may be updated by volume control later.
It's a good way to use the regmap cache(REGCACHE_RBTREE) to cache the volumes.

It's ok to integrate it into the chip init/reset.

We will evaluate the way to reduce the cost time of starting/stoping device:
Do PM by DAPM widget or set_bias_on.

We will start the start_work in dai->trigger if there is no clock bclk
for us to control, and disable fading in/out in firmware to reduce
the time consumption if it is needed(As a backup plan).

We can remove the registers dumping, and set the AMPS status to dev_dbg level.

OK, we add a sysfs node for this.

Understood, thanks a lot.

We evaluate to remove the resume/suspend(cold start up/down device):
The power consumptions between register settings and pins controlling are very close,
and it can help us to reduce the time consumption.
