Understood.

The start update should retain as soon as Platform uC acks the request.
And 2 notifications can be sent out for update procedure started and
completed. I don't see any issue there. What is the semantics you are
talking about ?

Even delayed response as some timeout so I would rather prefer to use
notifications in your usecase as it is completely async.

I think in your case, it is not even transport specific. It is more operation
specific and hence I prefer notifications.

Yes neither per-transport nor per-protocol timeout will suffice in your case.
This 10s timeout is specific to the update operation and hence use
notification. All other solution is just workarounds not generic solution.
