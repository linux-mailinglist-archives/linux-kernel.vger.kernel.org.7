Please don't top-posting [2]. The discussion thread is somehow messed.

They doesn't look like shortcomings to me. The corresponding destructor
callbacks have to be called when a device is removed anyway.

Instead, re-using the same inode for the userland interface however
*silently* swapping the underlying devices makes less sense to me.

My point here is: to let userland programs be aware of the underlying
device has been removed.

What are the reasons for disconnect and reprobe? From your previous message
and code comment, are they "reboot, sysjump, crash"? Would it happen
frequently after AP boot?

Note: we are talking about a EC-like device here. For a real EC either reboot
or crash, the AP will be reset.

No, I don't think so. I think all EC-like devices share the same concern
regardless of the transport medium (e.g. SCP over RPMSG, ISH over ISHTP).
