Right. I missed the read-heavy part. It still feels somewhat weird to
split variables you know are modified together, but alas.

Also, I might be reworking/removing queue_mask again soon, we'll see if
that pans out.

Most places that take rq->lock also update rq->clock. So I was wondering
if it made sense to put them together. I don't have numbers either.

Works for me.

Lets make it so.

Thanks!
