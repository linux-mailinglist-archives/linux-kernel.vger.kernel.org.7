This one is not any better to the previous. Why avoid? When avoid?
I already said that: for objects, having positive self-explaining
noun names is much better than negative and/or function-style verb
names. I suggested cpu_paravirt_mask, and I still believe it's a much
better option.

Static keys are not free and designed for different purpose. You have
CONFIG_PARAVIRT, and I don't understand why you're trying to avoid
using it.

I don't mind about static keys, if you prefer them, I just want to
have feature-specific code under corresponding config.

Can you please print bloat-o-meter report for CONFIG_PARAVIRT=n?
Have you any perf numbers to advocate static keys here?

Did this extra whitespace escaped from the previous line, or the following?

I think it's possible that existing codebase will do that. And because
you don't want to break userspace, you should not restrict.
