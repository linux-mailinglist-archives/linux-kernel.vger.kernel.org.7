I implicitly meant that A would be removed. After step 3  SSD is swapped off, 
tier A would be REMOVED via the interface.

Yes, exactly.
I also think cgroups should hold references.
If we only rely on swap devices for references, complexity decreases, but 
the issue I mentioned could still occur.

I also disagree with reassigning the same name.

Assuming no cgroup tier references exist, I was referring to a situation where 
"A" is removed and then reassigned.
In that case, the cgroup that originally specified "A" would be unable to 
reference its intended tier range.
If we align on holding cgroup references, the concern I raised would be 
cleanly resolved.

Yes, I agree!

Ack.
So for the missing case, is it "nothing"? 
Isn't it that we inherit from the parent and then incrementally add or 
remove from there?

Ack. Thank you once again for the detailed pseudo-code proposal.

Yes, I'll think about this more and share if I have something clearer to 
discuss.

I'm reconsidering this part.

Previously, I thought about holes because we weren't holding cgroup's tier
references.
If there's no swap device but a cgroup references a tier, and we remove 
that tier and let it merge, it would be very confusing for the cgroup 
holding the reference. They implicitly uses other tier's the swap devices
(That's why I proposed cgroup mask invalidation + holes.)

If cgroups hold tier references, suppose a specific assigned middle tier 
disappears.
Then, merging this tier seems more natural.
Since no swap device or cgroup is using the disappearing tier, merging 
the tier's priority itself shouldn't be problematic.
From the perspective of the tier being merged into, since there are no 
swap devices in the merging tier, it won't end up using unintended swap 
devices, so it shouldn't be an issue.

So I'm thinking maybe we should go back to full range coverage + tier 
merge.

Yes, we seem to agree on most things.
Thank you again for the review!
