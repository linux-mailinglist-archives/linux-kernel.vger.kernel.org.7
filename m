I don't have much of an opinion on on that. But maybe refactoring types.rs
should be an independent task?

Yes, I guess that sounds sloppy.

I guess you have a point. The shortened version is probably good enough.

Okay with all of the above.

>=20

I have been thinking about that. But this would mean that the blanket
implementation for `Deref` would conflict with the one for `OwnableMut`.

    A wrapper around `T`.

maybe?

Hmm, it is an important feature of the wrapper that it turns the `*Ownable`
into an object that is automatically dropped. So shouldn't that be
mentioned here?

"owned" means that access to the `T` is exclusive through the `Owned<T>`,
so normal Rust semantics can be applied.

Good point. That documentation hasn't been updated since `&mut T` access
has been split out into `OwnableMut`. Not sure how to phrase it now.

I guess it follows from:

Okay, sure, it not in the safety requirement.
