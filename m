But existing scripts running something like this will continue to
work, correct?  (It looks like they do, just checking.)

tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh --torture rcuscale --allcpus --duration 5

Don't get me wrong, your debugfs read-out performance increase looks
quite good, but these tests run in a guest OS with minimal userspace.
And by "minimal", I mean that they run out of an initrd having a root
filesystem consisting of a single statically linked "init" program.  ;-)

The usual use cases run only writers except for stress tests, but this
seems like a good capability.

New files in procfs face serious scrutiny, so your choice of debugfs
is a good one.

Back in the old days, I would have insisted on space/tab separated fields.
But gawk now supports a --csv flag, so I don't feel strongly about this.

The theory back in the day was that the updater would spend enough time
blocked that this would not matter.  However, you have shown that it
clearly does matter.

Except that running the reader and writer on the same CPU seems to
*improve* grace-period latency, with P99 value duration of 121,004
microseconds for overlapping (your first patch 4/4 experiment) and of
218,018 microseconds for non-overlapping.  Since shorter grace periods
are usually considered better, this suggests better performance with
the reader and writer running on the same thread.

Or am I misreading your commit log?

It would not be too surprising for the overlapping case to provide
faster grace periods because you are running PREEMPT=n and the writer
kthread would force context switches more frequently.  But I figured
that I should check.

This does not apply on the dev branch of my -rcu tree.  Which is not too
surprising because kernel-parameters.txt is subject to change.  But when
you repost to fix the bug that kernel test robot detected, could you
please let me know what mainline version you are developing against?
That would allow me to apply it there and then to rebase and resolve
conflicts as needed.

							Thanx, Paul
