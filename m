But reserved memory scanning relies on memblcok being already setup
(see: early_init_fdt_scan_reserved_mem->__reserved_mem_reserve_reg->early_i=
nit_dt_reserve_memory()
which uses:
memblock_overlaps_region, memblock_is_region_reserved,
memblock_mark_nomap and memblock_reserve and therefore we can't move
scanning earlier than e820__memblock_setup(). We can move early
mapping and reserved memory scanning part(actually entire
x86_flattree_get_config) at the end of  e820__memblock_setup but there
will be still remaining issue with e820 not being with sync which will
affect mentioned earlier e820 based assumptions for e.g.
e820__setup_pci_gap and e820__reserve_resources.

I've prepared v3 which moves x86_flattree_get_config earlier in the
setup process and prepared patch, which updates e820 table
accordingly: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250430084138.2287031-1-jaszczyk@=
chromium.org/.
Could you please take a look?

Best regards,
Grzegorz
