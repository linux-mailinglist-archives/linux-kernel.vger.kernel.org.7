Before the support for LTTPRs has been merged, if you would have one of
those docks (I do not own one) with LTTPRs, link training would've just
failed if the LTTPRs were not by default in transparent mode, which IIRC
is what the standard dictates.

X13s doesn't have LTTPRs on-board so when reading the caps, LTTPRs count
would return 0 and none of the of the transparent/non-transparent setup
would happen. Now, as already mentioned, DP would be considered already
broken (or rather not supported) if you would connect a dock with LTTPRs in it.

With the support in, if one such dock is used, the training should be
successful as all LTTPRs are set in transparent mode. This I was not
able to test myself as I do not own such a dock.

The LTTPR support did not break existing (working) setups because on these
setups, LTTPR count would read 0 and would be basically a no-op.

I'm not sure about what this actually fixes. It might be that is
specific to a dock or something. But as far as X Elite boards go, even
without this "fix" display has been working fine.

The change itself makes sense though and I think makes sense to be marked as a fix.
