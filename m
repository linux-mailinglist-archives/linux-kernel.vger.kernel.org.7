Thank you for clarifying, Simon.

Because this is an ABI change that difficult to revert and therefore we may
need to support for long term, I'd like to have more clear theory and/or data
if possible.  In my humble opinion, above clarification doesn't sound like a
strong enough justification for ABI change.

More specifically, it would be better if you could answer below questions.  Who
would be such users, how common the use case would be, and what are the benefit
of doing so?  Is that only theory?  Or, a real existing use case?  Can you
share measurement of the benefit from this change that measured from real
workloads or benchmarks?  Is there an alternative way to do this without ABI
change?

In my humble opinion, we can consider setting it true by default, if we agree
the benefit of the change is significant.  With only currently given
information, I cannot easily say if I think this can really be useful.  As
asked abovely, more clear thoery and/or real data would be helpful.

Thank you for accepting my suggestion.  But I think it deserves 3 patches, each
for

- memory-tiers.c,
- DAMON core layer, and
- and DAMON sysfs interface.

But, let's further discuss on the high level topic (if this change is really
beneficial enough to make ABI change).


Thanks,
SJ
