I just want to re-emphasize, it was *not* my intent to gripe at you
about this. A big reason I test new kernels is in the hope I can hit
things like this myself and get them fixed before they impact the wide
userbase, I'm only frustrated I'm probably too late here to do that.

IMHO the date of the release (Jan 2024) is more relevant than the
commit date, but it's not really that different in this case.

I think there's merit to the idea that the lack of complaining is a sign
that most users have not had to adjust yet, because if they had, they'd
have complained about it. But I don't have any real data either way.

The objections raised over the new interface naming in ixgbe are in no
way specific to ixgbe. You can s/ixgbe/i40e/ any mail about it and
nothing really changes. They're generalized objections against the
renaming of interfaces, so from a certain POV people *are* actively
complaining.

Heh. Thank you very much for checking that, and for the links.

Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree, it's udev after all that decides to
read the thing in /sys and name the interfaces differently because it's
there...

In any case, Debian stable is on 6.12 and didn't patch it (just
checked), so I concede, it is simply too late :/

Thanks,
Calvin
