Hi, David, Peter

Sorry for reviving an old thread. I've tried to keep the context as-is.
Here is an original link in the archives:

I assume there are already mechanisms in place to deal with that to some degree, because the driver cannot go away while any VMA still has the VM_PFNMAP mapping -- otherwise something would be seriously messed up.

The fix seemingly has not been applied so the issue in question still
persists. There is a long thread on that patch without an explicit
conclusion. Did the patch cause any problems or its status changed?


Thanks for your time!
