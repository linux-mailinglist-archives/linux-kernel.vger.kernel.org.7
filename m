Aside from the timer modularization part here which is proving a bit
contentious are
you OK with queueing the other parts of this MCT series?

As I need some of the MCT driver changes to enable CPUIdle on Pixel 6 upstream.
Exiting from c2 idle state is broken for gs101 without some of these
MCT changes.

MCT is hardware very specific to Exynos based SoCs. Forcing this
built-in is just
bloat for many other systems that will never use it.

The aim of this series is to upstream the downstream OOT code with the goal of
then switching over to the upstream version of the driver.

I agree with your points though that we should be sure the timer framework can
handle this, and we aren't introducing subtle bugs.

It's a good question. We can say it's been used as a module on
multiple generations
of Pixel devices in production without issues. Whether that covers all
timer use cases
I can't say.

For gs101 / Oriole deep idle states are used after loading the module as if the
MCT timer *isn't* used then the CPU can't wake up from c2 and eventually there
are no CPUs left leading to a hang.

Hopefully the above answers go a little bit towards giving a degree of
confidence
that this is a safe change :)
