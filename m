I think that's probably the right way to go, though. Moving the
configuration to firmware just means you now have two problems instead
of one.

It looks like MTK may have done something similar:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250616025628.25454-7-xueqi.zhang@mediatek.com

so if changes are needed to irqchip to handle the limited capabilities
of the extra logic (as per Marc's comments in the thread above), it
would be good to make sure that's reusable. What I really _don't_ want
is a half-baked, custom interrupt handling mechanism in the IOMMU code.

Sounds like you need to feed that back to the geniuses who designed this
hardware :). If you want your hardware to work well with existing
software, it's generally best to build it to spec.
