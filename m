Hi Andrey,

I am working on the PCI portion of the live update and looking at
using KSTATE as an alternative to the FDT. Here are some high level
feedbacks.

KHO does more than just serializing/unserializing. It also has scratch
areas etc to allow safely performing early allocation without stepping
on the preserved memory. I see KSTATE as an alternative to libFDT as
ways of serializing the preserved memory. Not a replacement for KHO.

With that, it would be great to see a KSTATE build on top of the
current version of KHO. The V6 version of KHO uses a recursive FDT
object. I see recursive FDT can map to the C struct description
similar to the KSTATE field description nicely. However, that will
require KSTATE to make some considerable changes to embrace the KHO
v6. For example, the KSTATE uses one contiguous stream buffer and KHO
V6 uses many recursive physical address object pointers for different
objects.  Maybe a KSTATE V3?

I can add more of the pain point of using FDT as data format for
load/restore states. It is not easy to determine how much memory the
FDT serialize is going to use up front. We want to do all the memory
allocation in the KHO PREPARE phase, so that after the KHO PREPARE
phase there is no KHO failure due to can't allocate memory.
The current KHO V6 does not handle the case where the recursive FDT
goes beyond 4K pages. There is a feature gap where the PCI subsystem
will likely save state for a list of PCI devices and the FDT can
possibly go more than 4K.

FDT also does not save the type of the object buffer, only the size.
There is an implicit contract of what this object points to. The
KSTATE description table can be extended to be more expressive than
FDT, e.g. cover optional min max allowed values.

Right, I need to write a lot of boilerplate code to do the per
property save/restore. I am not worried too much about memory usage. A
lot of string keys are not much longer than 8 bytes. The memory saving
convert to binary index is not huge. I actually would suggest adding
the string version of the field name to the description table, so that
we can dump the state in KSTATE just like the YAML FDT output for
debugging purposes. It is a very useful feature of FDT to dump the
current saving state into a human readable form. KSTATE can have the
same feature added.

It seems the KSTATE uses one contiguous stream and the object has to
be loaded in the order it was saved. For the PCI code, the PCI device
scanning and probing might cause the device load out of the order of
saving. (The PCI probing is actually the reverse order of saving).
This kstate_register() might pose restrictions on the restore order.
PCI will need to look up and find the device state based on the PCI
device ID. Other subsystems will likely have the requirement to look
up their own saved state as well.
I also see KSTATE can be extended to support that.

The field can't have both bits set for KS_BASE_TYPE and KS_STRUCT
type, right? Some of these flag combinations do not make sense. This
part might need more careful planning to keep it simple. Maybe some of
the flags bits should be enum.

I think we want to describe different stream types.
For example the most simple stream container is just a contiguous
buffer with start address and size.
The more complex one might be and size then an array of page pointers,
all those pointers add to up the new buffer which describe an saved
KSTATE that is larger than 4K and spread into an array of pages. Those
pages don't need to be contiguous. Such a page array buffer stores the
KSTATE entry described by a separate description table.

The version for the kstate_description might not be enough. The
version works if there is a linear history. Here we are likely to have
different vendors add their own extension to the device state saving.
I suggest instead we save the old kernel's kstate_description table
(once per description table as a recursive object)  alongside the
object physical address as well. The new kernel has their new version
of the description table. It can compare between the old and new
description tables and find out what fields need to be upgraded or
downgraded. The new kernel will use the old kstate_description table
to decode the previous kernel's saved object. I think that way it is
more flexible to support adding one or more features and not tight to
which version has what feature. It can also make sure the new kernel
can always dump the old KSTATE into YAML.

That way we might be able to simplify the subsection and the
depreciation flags. The new kernel doesn't need to carry the history
of changes made to the old description table.

Again this restoring can happen in a different order when the PCI
device scanning and probing order. The restoration might not happen in
one single call chain. Material for V3?

I am happy to work with you to get KSTATE working with the existing KHO eff=
ort.
