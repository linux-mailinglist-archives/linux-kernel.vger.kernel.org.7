Sorry, my previous reply wasn’t entirely accurate. The first event
(cpu/mem-loads-aux/S) succeeds because it’s not a precise event
(precise_ip == 0).

The second event fails with -EINVAL because, on some platforms, events
with precise_ip = 3 must be scheduled on fixed counter 0, and it fails
if it happens that this counter is unavailable.

In the current code, the first fallback attempt (inherit = 0) also fails
because the inherit attribute differs from that of the group leader
(first event).

But someone may argue that since presise_ip is per-event and it's less
intrusive, why not try it first?

If we want to keep this principle, we need to ensure that detect missing
features does not incorrectly remove valid features, and there’s no need
to restore the removed features.

After commit 3b193a57baf1 (“perf tools: Detect missing kernel features
properly”), it no longer checks attributes based on the previously
failed evsel. Instead, it checks against a dummy event. This  makes it
difficult to correctly detect features with complex dependencies — for
example, group events involves PERF_SAMPLE_READ, PERF_SAMPLE_TID, and
inherit.

Another argument is what if the original evsel fails because of multiple
invalid attributes? Seems it's hard to trust the missing feature
detection to find out "must-fail" attributes.
