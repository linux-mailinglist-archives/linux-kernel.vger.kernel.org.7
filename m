Yes.

libmpathpersist knows which scsi path devices map to the same Initiator,
but different target ports. When ALL_TG_PT is set, it only sends one
registration command to each group, instead of sending one to each path
device (like when ALL_TG_TP isn't set). If it sent a registration to
every SCSI device on these arrays that act like ALL_TG_PT is always set,
it would get reservation conflicts when sending the command to devices
using ports after the first, since they would already have a registered
key. That's why I mentioned the posibility of using Register and
Ignore, which doesn't care if there's a key already registered.

I don't think it would take much work for the Kernel API to support
ALL_TG_PT, if the SCSI implementation just passed the flag down to the
device. The problem really only exists for things like dm-multipath,
that are composed of a number of different devices that all point to the
same underlying Target LUN. To handle this without relying on something
like Register and Ignore, It would need to be able to group all the
devices that come from the same initiator but different target ports
together, and only send a registration to one device per group. This
takes more SCSI specific knowledge than it currently has, or really
wants to have.
