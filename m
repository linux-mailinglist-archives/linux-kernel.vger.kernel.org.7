Greybus was designed for a particular platform, but the intention
was to make it extensible.  It can be extended with new protocols,
and I don't think anyone is opposed to that.

I kind of assumed this.  I'm sure Andrew's message was not that
welcome for that reason, but he's right about trying to agree on
something in common if possible.  If Greybus can solve all your
problems, the maintainers will support the code being modified
to support what's needed.

(To be clear, I don't assume Greybus will solve all your problems.
For example, UniPro provides a reliable transport, so that's what
Greybus currently expects.)

I have no input on your throughput question at the moment.
