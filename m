I think we all agree on consumers setting the load for shared regulators, but
the naming and description of the DT property is what causing confusion here.
There is no way the consumers can set the *max* current draw for a shared
regulator. They can only request load as per their requirement. But the max
current draw is a regulator constraint.

Okay. This goes into the commit message and possibly some part of it to property
description also.
