Well, that's because the C side does not have anything else. But the C side has
no type system that deals with ownership:

In C you just stuff a pointer of your private data into debugfs_create_file()
without any implication of ownership. debugfs has a pointer, the driver has a
pointer. The question of the ownership semantics is not answered by the API, but
by the implementation of the driver.

The Rust API is different, and it's even implied by the name of the trait you
expect the data to implement: ForeignOwnable.

The File *owns* the data, either entirely or a reference count of the data.

If the *only* way to access the data the File now owns is by making it reference
counted, it:

  1) Is additional overhead imposed on users.

  2) It has implications on the ownership design of your driver. Once something
     is reference counted, you loose the guarantee the something can't out-live
     some event.

I don't want that people have to stuff their data structures into Arc (i.e.
reference count them), even though that's not necessary. It makes it easy to
make mistakes. Things like:

	let foo = bar.clone();

can easily be missed in reviews, whereas some contributor falsely changing a
KBox to an Arc is much harder to miss.

I think it could even be an implementation of Deref.

I don't really see what is complicated about File<T> -- it's a File and it owns
data of type T that is exposed via debugfs. Seems pretty straight forward to me.

Maybe the performance cost is not a huge argument here, but maintainability in
terms of clarity about ownership and lifetime of an object as explained above
clearly is.
