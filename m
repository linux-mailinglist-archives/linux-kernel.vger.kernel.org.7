Agreed, but we can predict that. You can infer just from the current state
of affairs. Today all machines based on soc X may need the quirk but the
firmware may vary across machines with same SoC.

SoC compatibles is debatable but if we are sure, we can do that.

Well theoretically I agree, but even if one machine based on that SoC
doesn't need it we need to fall back to specific compatibles. That's the
argument IIUC as the firmwares depend to be machine specific most of
the time and also newer machines based on the same SoC may carry fixes
that may remove the need for the quirks.

I was thinking about the same when I looked at the code. Using it is
more elegant IMO.

Nice! I am happy to have generic compatible if we are sure all the machines
based on or using it needs it. We can fix it up in the future if required
by dropping generic compatibles and add all the more specific ones if the
generic compatible breaks(meaning it doesn't need quirk) on any of the
machines based on it as it is always hard to predict such things.
