Sure, I mostly had to do error checking because I was using an
`ARef<Dir>` to represent a directory, which meant that the underlying
directory needed to be a valid pointer. Given that you've said that
the returned `dentry *` should never be used as an actual `dentry`,
only as an abstract handle to a DebugFS object, that requirement goes
away, and I can remove the error handling code and always successfully
return a `Dir`, even in cases where an error has occurred.

The explicit `drop` is not required for normal usage, it was intended
to be illustrative - I was trying to explain what the semantics would
be if the parent `dentry` was released before the child was. As
before, now that the child will not be an `ARef<Dir>`, and so not
assumed to be a valid `dentry` pointer, this example won't be relevant
anymore.

I incorrectly assumed that if a `dentry *` was being returned, then at
some point it would be used as a `dentry *` rather than as a
debugfs-only handle. I bound it into an `ARef` to avoid backing myself
into a corner later if someone needed to use the `dentry *` for
something, but if that's against the API contract of DebugFS, I can
avoid it entirely.
