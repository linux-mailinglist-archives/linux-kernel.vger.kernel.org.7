I feel this is much difficult, e.g. the patch 2 touches both drivers/clk
and include/soc/spacemit/k1-syscon.h - moving definitions, and splitting
into two patches sounds weird

ok, I agree, then let's route the whole series via clk tree, and I assume 
Stephen is fine with this, since it's indeed much simple.
