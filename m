+2. I maintain bitops, and I routinely have to take endianess into
account.

I just realized that I didn't run BE kernels for at least 3 years, and
didn't ask my contributors to do it for even more. The last BE-related
fix for bitops I can recall is dated back to 2020:

81c4f4d924d5d009 ("lib: fix bitmap_parse() on 64-bit big endian archs").

Nobody ever reported BE bugs for the new code.

Maintenance burden is not just a word. Things are getting really tricky
when you have to keep BE compatibility in mind. And it's a special
torture to run an old arm or sparc VM in BE-32 against modern kernels.

But what really important is that dropping BE support will make codebase
overall cleaner and better.

Thanks,
Yury
