Makes sense to me. I still have a slight concern though. We have 3
different oom handlers smashed into a single one with special casing
involved. This is manageable (although not great) for the in kernel
code but I am wondering whether we should do better for BPF based OOM
implementations. Would it make sense to have different callbacks for
cpuset, memcg and global oom killer handlers?

I can see you have already added some helper functions to deal with
memcgs but I do not see anything to iterate processes or find a process to
kill etc. Is that functionality generally available (sorry I am not
really familiar with BPF all that much so please bear with me)?

I like the way how you naturalely hooked into existing OOM primitives
like oom_kill_process but I do not see tsk_is_oom_victim exposed. Are
you waiting for a first user that needs to implement oom victim
synchronization or do you plan to integrate that into tasks iterators?
I am mostly asking because it is exactly these kind of details that
make the current in kernel oom handler quite complex and it would be
great if custom ones do not have to reproduce that complexity and only
focus on the high level policy.

This makes sense to me as well. I have to admit I am not fully familiar
with PSI integration into sched code but from what I can see the
evaluation is done on regular bases from the worker context kicked off
from the scheduler code. There shouldn't be any locking constrains which
is good. Is there any risk if the oom handler took too long though?

Also an important question. I can see selftests which are using the
infrastructure. But have you tried to implement a real OOM handler with
this proposed infrastructure?

I cannot see this in the code. Could you be more specific please? Where
is this might_fault coming from? Is this BPF constrain?

Yes, let's start simple and see where we get from there.
