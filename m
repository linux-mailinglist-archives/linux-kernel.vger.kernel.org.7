Thanks a lot for your careful reviewing, and sorry for late reply.

About kasan=off, we use static key to detect that, wondering if we will
have x2-x3 performance penalty. Not only can kdump get the benefit, but I
can think of one case where people may use kasan enabled kernel to detect
MM issues, while use kasan=off to make sure kasan code itself won't make
trouble. E.g you tested a normal kernel and it has no problem, while
kasan enabled kernel will trigger issue, sometime do we doubt kasan
code? In this case, kasan=off can prove its inonence?

This could be trivial, while I don't see much kasan=off introducing will
impact the old kasan performance and stir the current kasan implementation
code. We have got the kasan_arch_is_ready() anyway.

Right, I built kernel with below configs on, kasan=off|on works very
well.

=====
CONFIG_KASAN=y
CONFIG_CC_HAS_KASAN_MEMINTRINSIC_PREFIX=y
CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC=y
CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y
CONFIG_KASAN_STACK=y
CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC=y
CONFIG_KASAN_KUNIT_TEST=m
...
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y

Yeah, that would be great if we can also avoid any not needed memory
consumption for kdump.

Exactly. In this case, the code with the static key enabling or
disabling is clearer than CONFIG_ARCH_DEFER_KASAN setting or not.

Here I understand your reviewing policy. While I would like to explain a
little about my posting. I planned to do this job in 2023, made draft
patches on x86 for generic kasan, I dind't go further to try sw_tags
mode on arm64 because other things interrupted me. This year, I made
plan to disable some kernel features not necessary for kdump kernel,
mainly by adding kernel parameter like ima= I made, and later the
kasan=off.

aa9bb1b32594 ima: add a knob ima= to allow disabling IMA in kdump kernel

When I made patch and posted, I didn't see Sabyrzhan's patches because I
usually don't go through mm mailing list. If I saw his patch earlier, I
would have suggested him to solve this at the same time.

About Sabyrzhan's patch sereis, I have picked up part of his patches and
credit the author to Sabyrzhan in below patchset.

[PATCH 0/4] mm/kasan: remove kasan_arch_is_ready()
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250812130933.71593-1-bhe@redhat.com/T/#u

About reposting of this series, do you think which one is preferred:

1) Firstly merge Sabyrzhan's patch series, I reverted them and apply for
   my patchset.

2) Credit the author of patch 1,2,3 of this patch series to Sabyrzhan
   too as below, because Sabyrzhan do the unification of the static keys
   usage and the KASAN initialization calls earlier:

[PATCH v3 01/12] mm/kasan: add conditional checks in functions to return directly if kasan is disabled
[PATCH v3 02/12] mm/kasan: move kasan= code to common place
[PATCH v3 03/12] mm/kasan/sw_tags: don't initialize kasan if it's disabled
