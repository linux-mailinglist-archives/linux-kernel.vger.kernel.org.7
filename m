I second Haylen's suggestion here, instead of marking pll1_d8 as critical,
we should find out which is the precise clock, or if turns out pll1_d8
must be provided for some essential SoC/CPU/or Bus, then fine by me

right

It could be likely the system just hang without any output.. maybe bus hang
or something like that.. It would be great to poke vendor to get info
from high topology level..
