Great!  Then handle it there.

That's a design decision you made, don't force the kernel to do
something that you can do in userspace just because you made a foolish
decision in your userspace design patterns.

And really, how does your userspace restrictions keep you from doing
this in userspace?  What exactly prevents this?

> And although I don’t have insight into the exact design in Windows, but during testing on a standard Windows install, the device is correctly initialized with the vendor driver without any additional configuration or modification.

Watch what happens at device insertion on the bus to see how it decides
which configuration to pick.  Is Linux's logic different somehow?  It's
odd that only now would something like this start showing up.

This is a policy change of "if you can do it in userspace, you should.
