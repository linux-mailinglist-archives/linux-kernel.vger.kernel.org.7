Okay, I've bisected this.

TLDR: Linux and u-boot seem to have nothing to do with it, opensource
TF-A doesn't work, binary BL31 starting with v1.09 do not work. BL31
v1.08 and earlier work fine. Tested with vendor u-boot and with
2025.07-rc2, results are similar. OP-TEE presence does not affect the
results.

To test:
1. Build and apply a fresh u-boot-rockchip.bin using the DDR init and
BL31 from rkbin repo [1]
2. Run "watch cpupower -c 0,4 frequency-info" to observe how CPU
frequencies change
3. In a separate terminal, run "bash sbc-bench.sh -c" [2]
4. "Good" behavior:
    a. Once the cpufreq governor is switched to "performance" (if it
was anything different at boot), both CPU clusters go up to their max
frequencies
    b. While the benchmark runs through the stage where it says
"Checking cpufreq OPP", CPU frequencies consecutively decrease from
the max OPP frequency to the min
    c. After the benchmark finishes the stage where it says "Checking
cpufreq OPP", both CPU clusters go up to their max frequencies for the
rest of the benchmarking run
    "Bad" behavior:
    a. Once the cpufreq governor is switched to "performance" (if it
was anything different at boot), both CPU clusters stay at whatever
frequencies they were at when the switch occurred
    b. While the benchmark runs through the stage where it says
"Checking cpufreq OPP", CPU frequencies consecutively decrease from
the "pre-max" OPP frequency to the min (max frequency never gets
applied on either of the clusters!)
    c. After the benchmark finishes the stage where it says "Checking
cpufreq OPP", both CPU clusters stay at their min frequencies for the
rest of the benchmarking run

I suspect it has something to do with the topmost OPP somehow becoming
unselectable in ATF starting from binary BL31 v1.09 (and similarly in
opensource TF-A). This time I couldn't reproduce the "permanently
stuck" CPU frequencies though.

Here are the git bisect results (running in rkbin repo):

Derrick, if you could chime in on what might be going on here, that
would be greatly appreciated :)
