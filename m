Can you elaborate a)? I am not sure I understand it correctly.

Let's say we have 4 tier bit, firs two is default on/off.

bit 1: overwrite default on. bit 2: overwrite default off, bit3: zram
on, bit4, zram off

In this example, if we delete zram  how does the mask leave as it is
and follow a)?
I suspect you create a hole in the priority range and make swap
devices in that range not selectable.

We can leave them unassign as well. So after delete we have a hole in
the priority range. The swap device in that hole will not get more
swap out written to it, because it is not selectable from the
"swap.tiers". However the swap in can still happen on that device
until the device is swapped off. That sounds fine to me. I actually
like that better. Thank you for the suggestion.

I see. We don't need to jump to implementation details yet. I can help
you resolve the swap allocator internals as well. Let's have the
user's visible behavior settle down first.

That part will need to hack the current swap allocator regarding per

Ack.

That is what I consider the fast path modification in the swap cluster
based allocator. Let me think about it a bit. On the other hand, we
don't need to worry too much about the internals right now. We get the
effective tier selection bitmask and the swap cluster allocator just
honours it.

That is why I think the cluster cache which holds the current
allocation offset within a cluster might need to move to per swap tier
level or swap device level. Might be both.

I think this is close to what I am thinking, just some details haven't

I talked to Wei about swap tiers a bit. Add him to the CC as well. He
made me realize that we need two level things in the cgroup
"swap.tiers".
What we have discussed is the  "+ssd" with possible parent lookup
behavior is a kind of operation. The end result of the operation is a
tier bit set to indicate which tier is allowed in the swap out. The
end result tier netmask doenot need to have default, default is part
of the local operation selection. For the operation we also need two
bits per tier so we can specify on/off/missing.

For the operation, each tier will need two bits, including the
default. One bit select this timer off, one bit select this tier on.
e.g. we have 16 tiers including the default, then all 16 tiers take up 32 b=
its.

For example:
a/swap.tiers: "- +ssd" # default off, only allow ssd.
a/b/swap.tiers: "-ssd" # don't want ssd. the rest inherit the parent.

> A few thoughts aligned with the above:
> - There is no separate =E2=80=9Cdefault setting=E2=80=9D knob to control =
inheritance.

If there is no default knob. Every swap.tiers operation will need to
walk from the root to the current cgroup.
With default knob, the walk can terminate at the closest the parent
with the default overridden.

Also without default, how do you start with no swap then each child
has the option to add their own swap tiers?
That will force the parent to list and turn off each tier at the top
level memcg.

> - If unset locally, the effective value is derived by walking the cgroup
>   hierarchy from top to bottom.
Ack. In my mind, with or without local operation value, it needs to
walk the parent unless local has default override. Any local default
override will terminate the parent walking chain.

> - Once set locally, the local setting overrides everything inherited.
I need to think about that a bit. This is different from the original
inheritage appended from the parent operation syntax.
e.g. previously parent has "- +ssd" (nothing but ssd). child has
"+hdd", in the original proposal the effective is "- +ssd +hdd",
If you override the parent, then the child will become "- +hdd" (hdd
only). If the child wants to inherit the parent ssd behavior, it will
need to walk up the parent chain and set "- +ssd +hdd" instead of just
"+hdd".

It seems the append operation has the most flexible inherited
behavior, also more consistent. Need more discussion here.

> - There is no special =E2=80=9Cdefault tier=E2=80=9D when tiers are absen=
t.
If there is no default tier. Nothing is set in any of the
"swap.tiers", what is the behavior? Are all swap devices usable?
It seems we need the default in the swap.tiers operation. But the
final tier selection bitmask does not need default.

We can have more discussion and give more examples here. I still like
the "- +ssd -zswap" as well as "+ -ssd -hdd", that kind of operation
syntax, which seems to have more consistent inherage story, more
flexible, and less make up rules. It can support incremental add as
well as incremental subtract. I can be convinced otherwise as well. We
just need to allow each tier to have two bits, one bit for off and one
bit for one.

Wei also raises one very important point. Because zswap is not tight
to a swap device. We might want a predefined tier bit to describe
zswap. e.g. the first tier bit is always given to zswap and the tier
name is always zswap, the priority range can be assigned from
mm/swap/tiers interface.

Not necessarily true if we allow removal of the tier and generate
holes removed range as we discussed above. Unless I understand the
previous hole idea incorrectly.

For now. Ack.

That will make it a bit less than 32 tiers I think.

Ack.

Ack the TBD part. That also means removing the tier from global tiers
list we will need to walk all cgroups and clear the tier bits to get
used. Because removing is a rare operation, maybe that is fine.

Does that mean you can't do incremental add or incremental subtract tiers?

My suggestion now is "swap.tiers" is an operation rather than a
bitmask. It can include "default", Each tier can select on or off or
missing so 3 operation states. "default" tier has no name, if
specified, must be listed as the first in "swap.tiers"

Because removing the tier will generate holes in the priority range
anyway. 0-49 is not specified in the same as if a tier is there
previously then gets removed.

Specifically a new tier priority landing in the middle of a tier
range, the new tier will split the range with the existing one.

I don't think we need two interface files. We can live with one just
"memory.swap.tiers"
We can list the local one first then effective one on the second line
or separate with "#"

cat a/memory.swap.tiers # will show:
- +ssd # ssd
cat a/b/memory.swap.tiers  will show:
+hdd # ssd hdd.  The ssd is from the parent a/memory.swap.tiers.

I suggest that as the second line or after the "#" separator.

Ah, that will only allow incremental add, how about incremental subtract?

I think it is hard to store the range. I was thinking about the locals
as each tier takes 2 bits, on/off.
In that case if we want the exactly as configured, we need to store
the original expression as well.
Can we show the +ssd -hdd kind of evaluated tier operation there.
Store the original range expression will have complications when
removing the tier. It is complicate to clear the tier from the
original range.
effectively split the range. I was hoping the local internal storage
is the already processed bits of on/off.
Need more discussion here.

You might just spell out all the tier by name. The inherited behavior
will make it different from local, then the same set will have
different expressions to output it, using range or not. Just spell out
the tiers set might be simpler.
This is for debugging only anyway.
Consider joining this with the "swap.iter" output with a separation by
new line or "#".

>   - Inheritance: effective mask built by walking from parent to child,

I was thinking that the parent "swap.tiers" would be appended with the
child "swap.tiers". Only override when the child uses default on/off.
Need more discussion here.

Let's start with runtime. We can have a runtime and cached with
generation numbers on the toplevel. Any change will reset the top
level general number then the next lookup will drop the cache value
and re-evaluate.

Need discussion for incremental subtract. That syntax is incremental add.

Yes, I leave comments on the part I think needs more discussion.
