If we start with the common implementation you have here, nothing
prevents us from forking the code in future if the architectures diverge
so I'd be inclined to merge this series and see how we get on. However,
one thing I *do* think we need to ensure is that the relevant folks from
both arm64 (i.e. Ryan) and riscv (i.e. Alexandre) are cc'd on changes to
the common code. Otherwise, it's going to be a step backwards in terms
of maintainability.

Could we add something to MAINTAINERS so that the new file picks you both
up as reviewers?

Will
