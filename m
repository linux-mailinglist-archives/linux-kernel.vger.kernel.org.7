We agree on that part. The initialization is done from io_init. The disagreement is whether we have to wait in the resume() for the device to be fully initialized, see below.

I don't really see the problem here. The codec device (in the Linux sense) is trying to resume, and you want to wait until the hardware device is fully configured, no?

Moving the waiting part is asking for trouble: the device will be reported as pm_runtime active, but it may not even be attached on the bus, and thus any register access will lead to invalid read/writes.

For example, starting a register dump via debugfs would fail if the codec is not attached. The machine driver could also set jack status that would fail as well.

I really don't see the rationale for 'speeding-up' the resume and losing the guaranty that the device is fully operational. The whole point of the wait_for_completion() in the resume part was to avoid any problems between the pm_runtime state machine and the asynchronous nature of the bus attachment at the hardware level.

Unless I am missing something big, it feels like you are playing with fire to speed-up a resume time that was not reported as a problem. You may be right that the SoundWire setup needs to evolve, change is the only constant in this world, but from my perspective it's not clear if the benefits offset the unknowns and potentially racy behavior introduced by this resume change.
