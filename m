And the linear map :)

nit: A "leaf mapping" is the lowest level entry in the page tables for a given
address - i.e. it maps an address to some actual memory rather than to another
pgtable. It includes what the Arm ARM calls "page mappings" (PTE level) and
"block mappings" (PMD/PUD/.. level). apply_to_page_range() does support page
mappings, so saying it doesn't support leaf mappings is incorrect. It doesn't
support block mappings.

I don't understand what the HPAGE_PMD_MASK twiddling is doing? That's not right.
It's going to give you the offset within the 2M region. You just want:

split_range(start)
split_range(end)

right?

In other words, you are saying that this series is a prerequisite for Yang's
series (and both are prerequisites for huge vmalloc by default). Your series
adds a new capability that Yang's series will rely on (the ability to change
permissions on block mappings).

Thanks,
