Yep, the analysis from you two make sense to me. Will drop this patch.

The usage model ported from x86_64 is use "cma=4G@4G" in cmdline, and use
something like dma_alloc_from_continguous(NULL, 1 << 18, 18, false) to
get a huge buffer from 'dma_contiguous_default_area'

btw, I really like the 'numa_cma=' cmdline option, which helps our cma
usage a lot.

Strongly agree. Some platforms may have the 32bit limit, and many other
platforms which don't have to suffer from the limit. This kind of
flexibility should benefit users widely.

Something like below?
