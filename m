How? The driver needs the PCS to work. And the PCS can live on the MDIO
bus.

What makes it broken? The "mess" has already been made in netdev. The driver
authors have already pushed it off onto phylink.

And by "quite a bit of work to untangle" I mean the PCS affects settings
(ethtool ksettings, MII IOCTL) that are exposed to userspace as soon as
the netdev is registered. So we cannot move to a "delayed" lookup
without breaking reading/modifying the settings. We could of course fake
it, but what happens when e.g. userspace looks at the settings and
breaks because we are not reporting the right capabilities (which would
have been reported in the past)?
