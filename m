The parent is a "simple-bus", there is no parent regmap. And before
you say make the parent a "syscon", I've explained why we cannot do
that.

Sure it is, plenty of devices have only a couple registers. There
are already examples all over from all kinds of devices, clocks,
muxes, GPIO extenders, ADCs, DACs, etc. that are real and separate
devices that function perfectly fine while only having one or two
programmable registers.

Re-read the first sentence: "If this ddr-pmctrl device is *not* modeled
as a syscon device". My comment is that ddr-pmctrl is not a syscon,
and so if we don't include any claim it is a "syscon" in the binding,
why do we have to follow the rules in the unrelated syscon binding
description.
