We would still support the superset device upstream, Bryan is simply
suggesting (correct me if I'm wrong) a different way of supporting
the superset device such that later adding support for the cutdowns
is less painful.

To this I 100% agree, and I've suggested the same before in
cases where we know a subset device is in the works. Sometimes
plans for a cutdown happen after we have added support and that
makes a bit of a mess (see J78424 / J742s2). Even when we know
this is going to happen we still make a mess of DT which we end
up having to clean up later (see AM62p / J722s).

Easy manipulation of the DT in this way was one of the promises
of "System Device Trees". Until we have that, the next best thing
is DT overlays. The solution here then is to factor out the components
we know will be conditional into a device tree overlays. These
overlays will be applied by default to form the superset DT as the
out-of-box supported device, while also allowing easy removal without
having the bootloader perform complex DT surgery. Win-Win

The plan we agreed on for this series (back in v2 IIRC) is to add
these items as part of the base board DT to match what is already
done for all our other devices. *then* we factor it out from all
devices in one go to make that series more coherent.

So if that sounds good, Bryan feel free to un-NAK this and we
we will be sure to make your task of supporting all these subset
devices much easier in the follow up series :)
