Fair enough, after checking your patchset once again I see your special
USB-UART converter. I get your point and will add the serial@ binding!

Since I don't have a MOS7840 USB-Serial to test it, it would be nice of
you if you could test it afterwards on your side as well.

I will test it again, thanks!

I really try to understand the issue you see which I don't.

To cycle back: You posted the following warnings:

| ttyUSB ttyUSB0: tty_hangup: tty->count(1) != (#fd's(0) + #kopen's(0))
| ttyUSB ttyUSB0: tty_port_close_start: tty->count = 1 port count = 0

As written earlier, the tty_kopen_exclusive() should mark the serial
port as kernel-only serial. Also as you said, this suppresses the first
warning.

Is your issue that serdev can't handle hangups (e.g. hot-plugs) yet and
that a serdev driver could try to access the tty while the .remove() is
in progress?

Regards,
  Marco
