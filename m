You're right... I'm not sure what I was smoking last night. For some reason I
read the pXd_clear() as "free". This approach looks good to me - very clever!
And you even managed to ensure the WRITE_ONCE() in pXd_clear() doesn't get
reordered after taking the lock via the existing dsb in the tlb maintenance
operation - I like it!

I'll send a separate review with some nits, but I'm out today, so that might
have to wait until tomorrow.

Thanks, and sorry again for the noise!
