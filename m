Finally got around having a look/test!

Thanks for adding all the SSE tests to kvm-unit-tests [1]! What a hidden
gem -- at least to me!

It would be nice with similar tests in kselftest, so that we can
exercise the SSE paths on the CI worker!

...and a couple of general comments that apply to all patches.

  * There are a bunch of checkpatch warnings/errors -- not all make
    sense, but some do!
  * Minor spelling errors in the commit messages, that codespell
    catches.
  * There are some new unused variables warnings in the build.

Most of that (modulo the spellchecks) in PW [2].
=20=20
I'll have some minor things in the other patches.


Thanks for working on this, and looking forward to having it land!
