Hello Thomas,

Thanks for your word, really appreciate it.
Though I can understand abit why Yury was annoyed for this patch, at the
patch [1] I sent earlier, it already collide with Yury's patch, he did
paste the link of his patch for me, but I only take a look at the patch
in the link, not the whole patch series.
And then I send this patch, again collide with his work, if it were me, I
might feel the same like alittle bit of offended.

I send this patch because after I send this patch [2] , I think of
Kuan-Wei's patch [3] months ago and see there might be a use case here,
so I ask Kuan-Wei whether I can pick up his work.

I admit I wasn't paying attention to detail enough when looking at other's
work, neither did I subscribe the mailing list cuz I don't want my mail
box to be exploded with mails that aren't sent to me.

My workflow for patches was making sure it works as expected, and then
use scripts to check patch format, get maintainers, and then send it. I
know there's always room for improvments or something I might've done
inappropriately, that's why I always send the first patch with RFC tag.

That's the whole story, I am sorry to Yury, but again I think the
accusation is too over, like I said earlier, if I mean to steal
someone's work, why would I send it directly to the author ?

Still, I respect Yury and his professions, months ago he gave me many
suggesetions and help in another patch.

That's why I send my patch [2] to him to asked him for some comments
even though he's not in the maintainers list of that file.
I would never want to offend someone I respect, I hope he can
understand.
