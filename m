Hi Arnaud,

It's been some holidays followed by business travel leading to delay in
my response here.

I can see your arguments regarding some DT properties which are hard to
discover via OP-TEE service and I have been trying to think of how to
handle it in a proper manner for a device on discoverable TEE bus. One
of my fellow kernel maintainers pointed out that other discoverable
buses in the kernel like PCI etc. already solved this DT dependencies
via having device specific bindings. You can have a look at a one
particular example of PCI device binding here [1]. In case of OP-TEE,
you can have a similar device binding with UUID under the OP-TEE
firmware DT node.

The current approach you are taking via probing device on platform bus
and then trying to move onto TEE bus isn't at all the compatible with
the driver model, it simply sets a bad example for the driver model.

No, we should try to avoid a vendor specific TEE driver especially if it's based
on similar OP-TEE based service which should be able to abstract out the vendor
implementation for the kernel.
