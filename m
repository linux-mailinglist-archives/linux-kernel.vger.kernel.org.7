You'd have to add parentheses and parameters, i.e.

  agp_amd64_pci_driver.probe(...)

to invoke the probe hook directly.  However, that wouldn't be an
acceptable approach, one needs to go through the API of the
driver core and not do things behind the driver core's back.

Right, it is somewhat silly, but this driver is for 20+ year old hardware
which is likely no longer in heavy use, the driver itself isn't actively
maintained anymore and might be dropped in a few years, so this approach
seemed like the least ugly and most acceptable option.

The real crime was to probe *any* PCI device and even make that the
default.  I think vfio_pci is probably the only other driver that
probes *any* PCI device and it does that only if requested by user
space I believe.  We'd risk regressing users if we changed the
"probe everything by default" behavior, so that's not a good option.

Thanks,

Lukas
