Providing some context: Anshuman has a private branch that adds D128 pgtable
support to the kernel (it does not yet do this for KVM). I originally created
this patch to fix a bug on that branch, so the "we are about to add ..." comment
really only makes sense in that context.

We are not yet ready to post D128 upstream - there are still a lot of questions
to answer - but Anshuman has been posting some of the reshuffling and cleanups
that prepare the way for D128 where (we think) it makes sense. The aim is to
reduce the diff as much as we can.

I think FIELD_* are always implicitly 64 bit, right? I could be wrong...

But I agree with the overall sentiment; where stuff is clearly crossing over
into KVM, which hasn't been tackled yet, don't post until we have a good view on
what KVM needs.

Thanks,
