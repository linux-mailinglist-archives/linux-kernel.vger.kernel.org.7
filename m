I'd like to explain why MMIO of IP blocks looks discontinuous.
As outlined in the description, this device contains two SNPS PHY IPs
including eUSB2 PHY and USB3.2/DP combo PHY, and is integrated
with the SNPS DWC3 USB controller. A top-level subsystem wrapper
sits above the PHYs and controller. This wrapper integrates these IPs
and is where the Tensor-specific implementation resides. It's essential
to touch these wrapper registers to control the underlying SNSP IPs.
Unfortunately, the top-level wrapper's MMIO space lacks a clear
boundary between these IPs. Specifically, the registers required to
configure a particular IP are not always adjacent to that IP, and in
some cases, multiple IPs may even share the same address space.

The following is the register layout overview:
- 0xc400000: Dedicated address space for DWC3 controller IP.
- 0xc410000: Dedicated address space for USB3.2/DP combo PHY IP.
- 0cc440000: Dedicated address space for the eUSB2 PHY IP.
                      While this is not in use, it should perhaps be
called out in
                      the binding for completeness.
- 0xc450000: This address range contains top-level wrapper registers
                      and its space is shared by two devices: the DWC3
                      controller and the eUSB2 PHY.
                      It includes control registers for the DWC3 controller
                      (e.g. hibernation control and interrupt registers) an=
d
                      the eUSB2 PHY (e.g. registers for USB2 PHY
                      frequency configuration).
                      Because the space is shared, the MMIO range for the
                      PHY becomes fragmented and is only allocated a size
                      of 0xc, as the remaining registers in this range are
                      assigned to the DWC3 controller.
- 0xc460000: This address range contains registers for other blocks
                      within the same top-level wrapper (such as PCIe PHY
                      and DP controller) which are not relevant to USB.
- 0xc637000: Another region of top-level wrapper registers.
                      This area is relevant to both the eUSB2 PHY IP
                      (e.g. control register for vbus valid) and USB3.2/DP
                      combo PHY (e.g. registers relevant to PHY firmware).

Thanks for taking the time to go through this wall of text.
This is definitely not an ideal register layout, but I'm open
to any suggestions on how best to address this fragmentation.
If discontinuous MMIO space is a concern, does it make sense to
make the wrapper registers a syscon node so that it can be
shared by multiple devices?

Apologies for the trouble, my intent was to address your feedback on v4
by describing the USB3/DP PHY block for completeness.
Like mentioned earlier, this device contains two underlying IPs: eUSB2
PHY and USB3.2/DP combo PHY. The device can operate in USB2-only
mode by initializing just the eUSB2 block without touching the USB3
PHY block - but not the other way around. The v4 patch reflected this
USB2-only configuration.
I tried to support the USB 2.0-only configuration in the binding by
making the USB 3.0 clocks and resets optional. However, if I
understand your comment correctly, the binding should describe
FULL hardware capability. I will make USB3 resources mandatory
in the next version, please let me know if I've misunderstood it.

The prefixes are to differentiate the clocks and resets for the
underlying two SNPS IP as outlined in the device description.
- eUSB2 PHY IP needs clocks and resets for the phy itself
  and its apb bus.
- USB3.2/DP combo PHY has its own clocks and resets for
  the phy, plus it needs a clock for its PHY firmware.
Technically these are two separate IPs, but they're deeply
integrated together so that they share top-level wrapper
register space (see the register layout above), and they
have implicit hardware dependency like mentioned earlier
(USB2 PHY can work without USB3 PHY, but not vice-versa),
hence I'm describing them in the same device.

Roy Luo
