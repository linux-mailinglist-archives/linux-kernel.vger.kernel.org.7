You absolutely should not be using the userspace consumer for this.

Why not?  This seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to want to do, if
only as far as generating notifications to userspace.

I'd expect the consumer driver to be listening for events and offering
some sort of handling and/or interface for this that's joined up with
whatever the consumer is doing.  That basically means that your initial
thought above sounds about right to me.
