That requires us to attempt to reproduce stuff when assigning CVEs?

And what architecture/target?  How do we do this for all of them?

Remember, we are averaging 13 CVE assignments a day, this has to be
automated in order for us to be able to manage this with the volunteer
staff we have.

Remember older kernels are updated but userspace isn't on many
platforms, so the combinations of userspace tools and the kernel
versions is not anything we are going to even be aware of.

This is open source, we can not, and do not, dictate use.  It is up to
the users of our software to determine if their use case matches up with
the reported vulnerability or not.  We can not do it the other way
around, that is impossible from our side.
