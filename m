Yes, in particular with the following patches backported:
(This series is here in the shortlog)

Which ones in particular do you think are critical?
I'm also happy to just use your branch for testing, so we align on
a common base, if you're willing to share it.
I'm not happy about having to test on backported kernels either, but
as long as this is necessary we might as well just share branches of
Android mainline kernel backports for EAS patches, we all do the
backports anyway.

So for Speedometer 2.0 I do:
Run one iteration.
Wait until device is cooled down (all temp sensors <30C).
Repeat 5x.

Sure, in that case it's just a 5 hour long sample video without
ads in between. I then static-branch between e.g. the two feec()s.
to collect the numbers.
1m of stabilising between static branch switches were energy numbers
are disregarded.

Well the OPPs may be quite far apart and while max-spare-cap strategy
will optimally balance the util within the cluster, this series deviates
from that, so you will raise OPP earlier once the util of the CPUs in
the cluster grow.
For illustration here's the OPP table for the tested Pixel 6:

A hypothetical util distribution on the little for OPP0
would be:
0:5 1:16 2:17 3:18
when now placing a util=2 task max-spare-cap will obviously
pick CPU0, while you may deviate form that also picking any
of CPU1-3. For CPU3 even a single util increase will raise
the OPP of the cluster.
As util are never that stable the balancing effect of
max-spare-cap is helping preserve energy.

On big (CPU6) OPP0 -> OPP1 the situation is even worse if the
util numbers above are too small to be convincing.

Not really, although given that the YT case is similar I don't
think this would be a one-off. Probably any comparable 3D action
game will do (our internally is just really nice to automate
obviously).

Honestly the stddev on these is so high that something needs to go
quite badly to show something significant in this, just wanted to
include it.

Does that include misfit pushes? I'd be interested if our results
vastly differ here. Just to reiterate, this is without misfit pushes,
only the "stuck on CPU" case introduced by 5/7.

I don't doubt that, but there's little to test with real-world use-cases
really...

Right, I actually do see an appeal of having the push mechanism in fair/EAS,
but of course also the series introducing it should have sufficient convincing
benefits.
