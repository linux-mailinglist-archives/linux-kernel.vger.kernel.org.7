Exactly. We will typically have the AM62A7 superset plan well in advance 
then as the platform ages we start defining cutdowns that may or may not 
function depending on the behavior of the drivers which creates the 
weird DT layout and even worse some fraction of the subset devices that 
may or may not boot and no indication if it even should.

Separating the core description of the hardware, so Zephyr, U-Boot, 
Coreboot, Barebox and whoever else can use and modify it, from the 
allocation/configuration of the hardware while Linux is running is the 
only way (in my eyes) this can possibly scale.

I can get behind that plan but I do still worry about how this scales. 
Many distributions are starting to look at UKIs as the solution to the 
exploding number of DTBs. Adding overlays will just add plutonium to 
this compressed DTB blob best-fit walk.
