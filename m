Hi, I'm out on holiday at the moment, returning on the 22nd April. But I'm very
keen to move this series forward so will come back to you next week. (although
TBH, I thought I was waiting for you to respond to me... :-| )

FWIW, having thought about it a bit more, I think some of the suggestions I
previously made may not have been quite right, but I'll elaborate next week. I'm
keen to build a pgtable splitting primitive here that we can reuse with vmalloc
as well to enable huge mappings by default with vmalloc too.

Thanks,
Ryan
