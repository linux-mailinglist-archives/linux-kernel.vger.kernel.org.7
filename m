I already have a V2 under test that will define a quirk using a
__VA_ARGS__ so that you can specify a variable number of compats to
match against the platform running using of_machine_compatible_match()

+/*
+ * Define a quirk by name (_qn) and provide the matching tokens where:
+ *
+ *  _ven : SCMI Vendor ID string, NULL means any.
+ *  _sub : SCMI SubVendor ID string, NULL means any.
+ *  _impl : SCMI Implementation Version string, NULL means any.
+ *          This version string can express ranges using the following
+ *          syntax:
+ *
+ *                     NULL            [0, 0xFFFFFFFF]
+ *                     "X"             [X, X]
+ *                     "X-"            [X, 0xFFFFFFFF]
+ *                     "-X"            [0, X]
+ *                     "X-Y"           [X, Y]
+ *
+ *          where <v> in [MIN, MAX] means:
+ *
+ *             MIN <= <v> <= MAX  && MIN <= MAX
+ *
+ *  _comps : NULL terminated array of compatible strings.
+ *          An empty array means any.
+ *
+ *  This implicitly define also a properly named global static-key that
+ *  will be used to dynamically enable the quirk at initialization time.
+ *
+ *  Note that it is possible to associate multiple quirks to the same
+ *  matching pattern, if your firmware quality is really astounding :P
+ */
+#define DEFINE_SCMI_QUIRK(_qn, _ven, _sub, _impl, ...)                 \

I will post V2 soon.

So what is your latest Firmware version read ? no more 0x20000

[    0.116746] arm-scmi arm-scmi.0.auto: SCMI Protocol ?? 'Qualcom:' Firmware version ???????

Good.
