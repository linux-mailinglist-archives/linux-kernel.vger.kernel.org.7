I don't think BUG_ON is the right behaviour; crashing the kernel should be
discouraged. I think even for vmalloc under correct conditions we shouldn't see
any unmapped VA. But vmalloc does handle it gracefully today; see (e.g.)
vunmap_pmd_range() which skips the pmd if its none.

It will change permissions of all the leaf entries in the range of VAs it is
passed. Currently it assumes that all the leaf entries are PTEs. But we will
generalize to support all the other types of leaf entries too.,

Yes I did. I think this made sense (in my head at least) because in the context
of the linear map, all the PFNs are contiguous so it kind-of makes sense to
reuse that infrastructure. But it doesn't generalize to vmalloc because vmalloc
PFNs are not contiguous. So for that reason, I think it's preferable to have an
independent capability.

I'm not sure I fully understand the point you're making here...

Dev's series aims to use walk_page_range_novma() similar to riscv's
implementation so that it can walk a VA range and update the permissions on each
leaf entry it visits, regadless of which level the leaf entry is at. This
doesn't make any assumption of the physical contiguity of neighbouring leaf
entries in the page table.

So if we are changing permissions on the linear map, we have a range of VAs to
walk and convert all the leaf entries, regardless of their size. The same goes
for vmalloc... But for vmalloc, we will also want to change the underlying
permissions in the linear map, so we will have to figure out the contiguous
pieces of the linear map and call __change_memory_common() for each; there is
definitely some detail to work out there!

Perhaps it may be sufficient to reuse the NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS and NO_CONT_MAPPINGS
flags? For example, if you are find a leaf mapping and NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS is set,
then you need to split it?
