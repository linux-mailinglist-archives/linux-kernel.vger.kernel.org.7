Yeah, I got the reason that pll1_d8 is disabled, but I don't still
understand why it matters: pll1_d8 is a simple factor gate, though being
parent of various peripheral clocks, it's okay to enable it again later
if some peripherals decide to use it or one of its child, isn't it?

I could come up with several scenarios where disabling the clock really
causes problems,

1. Some essential SoC components are actually supplied by pll1_d8 or one
   of its children, but isn't described in devicetree or the driver,
   thus disabling pll1_d8 leads to an SoC hang. We should mark the
   precise clock that being essential as critcal, instead of setting
   pll1_d8 as critical to work around the problem.
2. There're bugs in our clock driver, thus it fails to bring pll1_d8
   (or maybe also its children) back to a sound state. If so we should
   fix the driver.

Unless you could confirm pll1_d8 (not its child) really supplies some
essential SoC components, I don't think simply marking pll1_d8 as
critical is the correct solution.

And, I don't even know what "non-functioning system" behaves like. Could
you please provide more information, like soC behaviours or dmesg when
disabling pll1_d8 causes problems? Thanks.
