I don't see it happening yet. What I think will happen is they will add
more coprocessors and corresponding mailbox controllers. And I think we
should focus on what the current firmware implements and try to model
that.

I think we should just ask MediaTek if their firmware interface is fixed
and what they would do if they ran out of IPI space.

Sure, but it's more than likely they will add more IPIs to handle that.

That could work. Then again rpmsg is some software construct. Also not
all coprocessors implement the same thing. See below.

Is that direct messaging or going through some ioctl interface? I think
direct messaging to some system critical firmware without any sanity
checks is potentially dangerous.

It also creates new problems, such as resource handover. There are
internal regulators or clock controls that are controlled by the
firmware after the coprocessor is brought up. But until then, in
some cases those resources are still under the control of the kernel;
in other cases they are left turned on by the bootloader so as not
to block consumers. Some delicate (read: fragile) handover was done,
which I'm not very fond of.

For the code that MediaTek has provided for MT8196, I can say that there
are at least three types of firmware interfaces:

- ADSP

We're running SOF, so that might be different from the Android stuff that
you saw for 9300. The ADSP mailboxes don't have any shared storage or
channels. They are simply doorbells. The shared storage interface is
likely common to SOF implementations

- Tinysys over SCMI

This seems to be the main coprocessor, which seems to be the SSPM.
Judging by the associated drivers, the firmware implements a vendor
extension protocol (0x80) over SCMI, over which it provides various
commands.

From the code we have it looks like this part manages the QOS, SLBC, and
CM_MGR parts.

- Tinysys over mailbox controllers (with scratch registers)

This covers the other coprocessors such as VCP, GPUEB, MCUPM and
probably others that we don't currently have included in our tree.
This is the part we are discussing.

Given how the communication channels are crammed into the mailboxes,
it's unlikely you can get rid of said part-two implementation. There
needs to be something that maps individual channels onto the mailbox
channels and combined storage. The question is simply how we want to
model this. And regardless of whether it be rpmsg or virtual mailbox,
we will end up with some shared library code to implement this
translation. This is what currently exists as mtk-mbox.c and
mtk_tinysys_ipi.c under drivers/soc/mediaktek/ in our tree. I assume
there is something similar in the code that you have, given that
most of the code we have for MT8196 was ported over from their
internal trees without much modification.

mtk-mbox.c handles the grouped mailboxes, while mtk_tinysys_ipi.c provides
the IPI interface. I assume the latter is what you are referring to as
"part-two IPI". mtk_tinysys_ipi.c goes even further as it builds the
IPI interface on top of rpmsg (implemented in drivers/rpmsg/mtk_rpmsg_mbox.=
c).

What I would like to see is to drop the low level mailbox stuff from
mtk-mbox.c, move the mailbox combining and repartitioning bits to a
library that implements the IPI interface, using rpmsg or virtual
mailboxes or whatever. I don't see why this would end up with multiple
copies. The only thing that coprocessor drivers need to have is a
table on how the IPIs map to the mailboxes.

You'll have to provide a link to that. However I think a lot of the code
for MT8196 is derived from the same source.
