Yes, the patch will be bigger, but it's just a bunch of highly static code=
 copied straight out of the current kernel with very few touch points to th=
e rest of the kernel (which is why we didn't axe it together with i386 supp=
ort=2E Now that one was ugly, with touch points all over the place=2E)

It is basically the same idea as the arch/i486 I suggested, just in a sepa=
rate git tree (although I guess I don't really see how this is fundamentall=
y different than, say, arch/m68k=2E)

An i486/i586 retroport can presumably also axe a bunch of things like side=
 channel mitigations; most of them aren't applicable to the in-order i486/5=
86 pipelines and the rest =2E=2E=2E well, on a machine that slow, you are u=
nlikely to be running the kind of workloads that care=2E=20

Similarly, you should be able to simply unsupport the things that make the=
 entry/exit code a nightmare, like SYSENTER and fancy NMI hacks (the latter=
 requires an APIC=2E)

As far as I know, Transmeta Crusoe was the only i586-class CPU which suppo=
rted SYSENTER (if that version of the firmware even shipped, I'm not sure),=
 and Crusoe was "almost" i686 class in terms of ISA (mainly lacking PAE and=
 NOPL, and having P5-like flags behavior=2E)

There is a huge gap then to the i686, with the i686 being the direct ances=
tor of the x86-64 systems in terms of systems architecture (APIC, PAE*, etc=
; SYSENTER in the second iteration; a general tightening of the ISA definit=
ion; PCI universal by then=2E=2E=2E)

But again, this is all academic unless someone steps up and wants to take =
on such a project=2E

   -hpa

* =E2=80=93 I believe there was one version of the Pentium M which didn't =
have PAE, at least officially, although I understand that if you flipped th=
e CR4 bit it actually worked=2E I am guessing, without any concrete evidenc=
e, that there was a timing path and that it would fail at the highest opera=
ting temperatures on some subset of chips=2E
