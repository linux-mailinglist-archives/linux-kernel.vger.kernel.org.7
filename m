Fair enough, but it still stinks.

Well, it's not that bizarre and it has a massive performance win if the
thing does not need to go out to the hardware in some scenarios. Don't
ask about the main use case. Mentioning it is probably considered a
violation of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT).

I understand, but this needs more thoughts. Doing this wholesale for all
potential PCI/MSI parent domains which require MASK_PARTN makes me more
than nervous.

Well, it relies on that today already if the underlying parent domain is
capable of masking. If not, it hopes that nothing bad happens, which is
the only option we have :(

It get's worse when the device does not support masking _and_ the parent
domain does not provide immutable MSI messages because then the MSI
message write becomes a horrorshow. For illustration see the mess in
arch/x86/kernel/apic/msi.c::msi_set_affinity(), which is a violation of
above mentioned convention as well. Despite the fact that this has been
known for decades, RISC-V went ahead and replicated that trainwreck in
the IMSIC IP block. Oh well....

I sat down and stared at it in the few moments where the heat wave did
not completely shutdown my brain. As usual this ended in a larger
cleanup and overhaul... At the end I went and created a new pair of chip
callbacks and the corresponding logic around it. A preview of the whole
pile is at:
