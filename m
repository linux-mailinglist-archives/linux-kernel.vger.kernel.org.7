Sorry I have been super busy and late to the review party.

I am still catching up on my backlogs.

The cover letter title is a bit too long, I suggest you put the swap
table phase II in the beginning of the title rather than the end. The
title is too long and "phase II" gets wrapped to another line. Maybe
just use "swap table phase II" as the cover letter title is good
enough. You can explain what this series does in more detail in the
body of the cover letter.

Also we can mention the total estimate of phases for the swap tables
(4-5 phases?). Does not need to be precise, just serves as an overall
indication of the swap table progress bar.

That is wonderful we can remove SWAP_HAS_CACHE and remove sync IO swap
cache bypass. Swap table is so fast the bypass does not make any sense
any more.

 The THP swapin is still limited to SYNC_IO devices.  This limitation
can be removed later.
