FWIW, here's an example from just today where the crypto self-tests prevented a
buggy driver from being used in Debian:

Often the hardware offloads are actually slower.  They require sending the CPU
an interrupt once the operation is done, which has a lot of overhead.  They also
tend to be optimized for throughput rather than latency, and only provide good
throughput when given a large number of concurrent requests.

Inline encryption does actually work, but that is a separate type of accelerator
and not what we're talking about here.
