Some of the details about how directory hash trees work were confusing or
outright wrong, this patch should fix those.

A note on dx_tail's dt_reserved member, as far as I can tell the kernel
never sets this explicitly, so its content is apparently left-overs from
what was there before (for the dx_root I've seen remnants of a
ext4_dir_entry_tail struct from when the dir was not yet a hash dir).
