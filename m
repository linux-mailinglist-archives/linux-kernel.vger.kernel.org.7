f: This is what Yafang mentioned in [1]. sysadmins dont want to switch the =
global policy to madvise, but are willing to accept certain processes to ma=
dvise.

tely.

The interpretation of never as "disable THPs completely" makes sense
to me, as sysadmins need a guaranteed way to disable THP. If
applications could still allocate THPs in never mode, it would
frustrate sysadmins.

For case 3), I agree with Johannes that introducing a new mode (e.g.,
"blessed" or "bpf") would be ideal. This mode would allow per-task THP
policy adjustments via BPF programs, defaulting to never when no BPF
program is attached.
