Thanks for taking the time - much appreciated!

Oh look, Google is using SEV-SNP too. Non! Si! Oh!

AFAIR, this is what you've done for arm64 too, right?

THANK YOU!

So basically we can all slow down and do normal review and testing. Without
any of that hurried patching back'n'forth. And we didn't need any of that
grief!

Basically something which I've been trying to say from the very beginning but
no one listens to me!

Geez.

Thanks man, let's also sync on IRC.

We have enough time to run the set through all our testing pile and shake out
any outstanding issues.
