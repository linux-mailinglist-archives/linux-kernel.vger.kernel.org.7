Documented here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/filesystems/resctrl.rst#n482

The values are unique per-level, but also sparse, meaning they could be unique
system-wide. This is what will happen on arm64 ACPI platforms because the PPTT value gets
exposed directly.

This is mostly over my head!

Done,
