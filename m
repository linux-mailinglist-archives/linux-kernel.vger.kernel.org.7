HSM only specifies the state of a few registers and the ISA only a few
more. All other registers have IMPDEF reset values. Zeros, like KVM
selects, are a good choice and the best default, but if the VMM disagrees,
then it should be allowed to select what it likes, as the VMM/user is the
policy maker and KVM is "just" the accelerator.

The VMM should always be the only manager. KVM can provide defaults in
order to support simple VMMs that don't have opinions, but VMMs concerned
with managing all state on behalf of their users' choices and to ensure
successful migrations, will want to be involved.
