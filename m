I mean after record lost, let's say

  t1: SAMPLE for TID 1234, seq 10  (parallelism = 4)
  t2: LOST
  t3: SAMPLE for TID 1234, seq 10  (parallelism = ?)

I don't think we can continue to use parallelism of 4 after LOST even if
it has the same seq because it cannot know if other threads switched on
other CPUs.  Then do we need really the seq?

Well.. 2 pass itself can be a problem due to slowness it'd bring.  Some
people complain about the speed of perf report as of now.

I think we can simply reset the parallelism in all processes after LOST
and set current process to the idle task.  It'll catch up as soon as it
sees samples from all CPUs.
