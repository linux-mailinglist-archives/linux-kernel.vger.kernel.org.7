You reported various problems that accumulated thru over a decade, which
shows how difficult is to regression test TUIs :-\

We have 'perf test' to test various aspects of the tools, with C ones
testing APIs, shell ones running the tools and looking if they are
generating expected results by grepping output and using other
techniques, the perf test shell infrastructure is itself checked using
ShellCheck, if installed:

⬢ [acme@toolbox perf-tools-next]$ rpm -q --qf "%{description}\n" ShellCheck
The goals of ShellCheck are:

* To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues,
  that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages.

* To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems,
  that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.

* To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an
  advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.
⬢ [acme@toolbox perf-tools-next]$

A big regression test suite that lived/lives inside Red Hat,
created/maintained by Michael Petlan (and was continuosly used to test
perf) is being merged with it over time.

Ian did lots of work on making it parallel, with some tests needing to
be run exclusively as it changes global state (perf probe adding stuff,
etc).

But one area we lack is to test things that interact with the user, like
the TUI, something to improve!

So I'm rather happy when someone that uses the TUI comes along and
points out problems, as this isn't an area that we are automatically
testing, it all depends on sheer code review, with corner case bugs
living in the codebase for years, sometimes decades...

This one is a sore spot, I'll try to take a look.

I've folded your patch in the patch I added in this series while
addressing the other problems you pointed out with libunwind, ditto for
libbfd.

I'll work on that.

Great! the good thing was that minor changes were needed.

Right, I didn't even try to fix that one explicitely, it was that
do_zoom_thread() (that does zoom in and out) not having act->thread set
when handling the left arrow, that happens to also handle the ESC case.

Sure, I'll add a patch on top of this series doing that.

I did nothing in this regard, a good fallout from the other changes then.

Right, I think this is a case to use a popup window stating that the

Thanks, I added that to the patches and will use what I have right now
to open the perf-tools-next.git tree, so that in addition to this work I
start processing the many patches that are out there for 6.16!

Please, if you have further comments, just send them my way but do not
forget to CC perf's co-maintainer, reviewers and the mailing list, its
not always that I can focus on something like this ;-)

Cheers,
