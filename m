One extra question:Are you using RPMsg over virtio?

If yes, do you test the RPMsg name service (NS) announcement, that might also
address your needs.

The principle is that the remote processor sends a name service announcement to
Linux, which probes the rpmsg character device and creates the /dev/rpmsgX
device in a predefined order known by the remote processor.
In such a case, the /dev/rpmsgX usage would be determined by the remote
processor itself.

Another advantage is that the RPMsg channel creation is not driven by either the
host or the client. In such case host does no need to define/kwnow RPMSg
endpoint addresses.

You still need to call the open() file system operation, but this should be done
one time during Docker client initialization.

Arnaud
