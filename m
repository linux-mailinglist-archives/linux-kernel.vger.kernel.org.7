I do understand this statement.

But I fail to follow this. The commit itself says Fixes: a49d25364dfb
("staging/atomisp: Add support for the Intel IPU v2") which makes it
clear since when the issue has been introduced. If this tag was not
present then there is CVE-$FOO.vulnerable which can specify the same
thing. I do not understand how 51b8dc5163d2 is related as it has a
different implementation of ia_css_3a_statistics_allocate that doesn't
have any unchecked kernel allocations AFAICS.

We have identified that CVE-$FOO fix has been incomplete so far and
extended list of fixes required for this CVE. Please make sure that
those are appplied.

Or something in those lines.

Nope, being aware of what is actually the CVE fix is the most important
information. Which kernels are affected specifcally is something that is
downstream specific and stable tree ranges are only of a value to those
who are using stable trees. Updates to vulnerable files is helpful
during evaluation phase but once the assessment is done it acts mostly
as a double check.
