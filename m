1 or more error strings in every single driver is what bloats the 
kernel, not 1 string. It's all kernel code and memory usage whether it's 
core or drivers.

request_irq() is not always fatal. Some drivers fallback to polling. In 
general, we've been adding _optional() variants of functions to return 
NULL rather than errors which is handled silently by subsequent API 
calls. Secondarily, those print errors in the non-optional case. It's 
not real consistent in this area, but something we should improve.

One thing that's really hard to debug in C drivers is where an 
error came from. You can for example turn on initcall_debug and see that 
a driver probe returned an error. It's virtually impossible to tell 
where that originated from. The only way to tell is with prints. That is 
probably the root of why probe has so many error prints. I think we can 
do a lot better with rust given Result can hold more than just an int. 
We obviously can't get back to the origin if that was C code, but just 
if we know exactly which call from probe failed that would be a huge 
improvement.
