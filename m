Ok, let me explain..

I've queued it at for-next but haven't sent out the "Applied" reply email,
it should be eventually merged for version v6.17 if things goes well.. 

the reason that I haven't pushed it hard for fixes branch is that only DMA 
is affected for now, but DMA isn't fully activated in current mainline
(No DT, No config merged), so I think it's fine if we target for-next..
