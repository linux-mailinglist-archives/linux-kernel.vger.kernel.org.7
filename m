Feel free to open the issue :)

Ah yes, I meant "shared with other Rust code through the C side" ie the
pointer round-trips through C (that isn't actually relevant, but that's
why I mentioned C).

It's fine, since all non-ZST fields are `Opaque`. Otherwise we'd need to
wrap all fields with that.

We don't lose anything by doing this, so I think we should do it.
If in the future someone invents a way `MiscDevice` that's only in the
current thread and it can be registered (so like a "thread-local"
`MiscDevice` :), then this will be less painful to change.
