Didn't they use sysfs events (i.e. '-e PMU/EVENT/' form) always?

Right, sometimes it's not 100% clear and descriptions would be nice.

Oh, looks like it's too permissive.  Do we have speculative-load in the
standard cache events?

Hmm.. ok.  I feel like cache events should have lower priority at least.
If it's all about metrics, maybe we can add something like a new parse
option like parse_evens_option_args.prefer_json to have different
priority settings and use it for metrics?

Well.. I think cycles is an alias to cpu-cycles so they are the same.
So it's not about special casing 'cycles'.  Any PMU may add conflicting
event names to sysfs (which is discouraging though).
