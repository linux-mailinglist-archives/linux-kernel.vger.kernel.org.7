In this case, all device private entries pointing to this device private
folio should be turned into migration entries and folio_mapcount() should
be 0. The split_device_private_folio() is handling this situation, although
the function name is not very descriptive. You might want to add a comment
to this function about its use and add a check to make sure folio_mapcount(=
)
is 0.

For partial unmap case, you should be able to handle it in the same way
as normal PTE-mapped large folio. Since like David said, each device privat=
e
entry can be seen as a PROTNONE entry. At PMD split, PMD page table page
should be filled with device private PTEs. Each of them points to the
corresponding subpage. When device unmaps some of the PTEs, rmap code
should take care of the folio_mapcount().
