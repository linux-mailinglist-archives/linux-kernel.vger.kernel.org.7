I like the idea and I think it is also easily usable in a nested 
environment, where for example in L1 we can decide whether or not a 
namespace can access the L0 host (CID=2), by adding 2 to 
/proc/net/vsock_cid_outside

This is maybe a little overkill, but I don't object to it!
It could also be a next step. But if it's easy to implement, we can go 
straight with it.

Yeah, I see that!
However, should this be paired with a sysctl/sysfs to do opt-in?

Or can we do something to figure out if the user didn't write these 
files, then behave as before (but maybe we need to reverse the logic, I 
don't know if that makes sense).

Yes, I agree that we should avoid it if possible.

Thanks for your points!
