The reason here is that you are mixing platform and TEE bus for remoteproc
driver. For probe, you rely on platform bus and then try to migrate to
TEE bus via rproc_tee_register() is the problem here. Instead you should
rather probe remoteproc device on TEE bus from the beginning.

You should have rather used the DT property "secure-status" [1] to say
the remoteproc device is being managed by OP-TEE instead of Linux. Then
the Linux driver will solely rely on TEE bus to have OP-TEE mediated
remoteproc device.

I rather mean here whichever properties you can currently dicovering via
DT can rather be discovered by invoke command taking property name as input
and value as output.

By multiple remote processors, do you mean there can be multiple
combinations of which remote processor gets managed via OP-TEE or not?

I think the memory regions including the resource table can also be
probed directly from the TEE service too. Is there any other DT property
you rely upon when remoteproc is managed via OP-TEE?
