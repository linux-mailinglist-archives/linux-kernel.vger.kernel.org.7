Yes. Effectively shared memory (but in another address space so need to
use readq(addr) rather than just *addr to read values to keep sparse
happy).

Yes. If perf is enhanced to take CLOSID/RMID into account when
accumulating event counts it can provide the same functionality.

Higher overhead since perf needs to sample event counters of
interest on every context switch instead of data collection
being handled by hardware.

On the other hand the perf approach is more flexible as you can
pick any event to sample per-RMID instead of the fixed set that
the h/w designer chose.

Resctrl gets the id from topology_physical_package_id(cpu);

These package IDs show up on x86 with these file names:

$ grep ^ /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/*package*
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/package_cpus:0000,00000fff,ffffff00,0000000f,ffffffff

Resctrl goes to some lengths to have mbm_total_bytes start from zero
when you mkdir a group even when some old RMID is re-used that has
got some left over value from its previous lifetime. This isn't
overly painful because resctrl has to carry lots of per-RMID state
to handle the wraparound of the narrow counters.

The Intel telemetry counters are 63 bits (lose one bit for the VALID
indication). So wrap around is no concern at all for most of them
as it happens in centuries/millennia. Potentially the uops_retired
counter might wrap in months, but that only happens if every logical
CPU is running with the same RMID for that whole time. So I've chosen
to ignore wraparound. As a result counters don't start from zero when
a group is created. I don't see this as an issue because all use cases
are "read a counter; wait some interval; re-read the counter; compute
the rate" which doesn't require starting from zero.

You'd have resctrl report "Unavailable" for these until connecting the
plumbing to perf to provide data?

Reinette is adamant that format of each resctrl event file must be
fixed. So if different systems report residency in different ways,
you'd either have to convert to some common format, or if that isn't
possible, those would have to appear in resctrl as different filenames.
E.g. "residency_absolute" and "residency_percentage".

Almost certain to have a new description for each CPU generation since
the number of RMIDs is embedded in the description. If the overall
structure stays the same, then each new instance is described by a
dozen or so lines of code to initialize a data structure, so I think
an acceptable level of pain.

Maybe. There are a number of parameters that need to be provided for an
event:
1) Scope. Must be something that resctrl already knows (and is actively
using?) L2/L3 cache, node, package.
2) Base address(es) for counters for this event.
3) Parameters for F(RMID) to compute offset from base
4) Type of access (mmio_read, MSR_read, other?)
5) post-process needed after read (check for valid? maybe other things)

Might be best to try some PoC implementation to see which of those are
required vs. overkill. Also to see whatI missed from the list.
