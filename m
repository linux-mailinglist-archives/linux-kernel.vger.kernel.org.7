It may be nothing, but to me this is getting too much of a coincidence.

I have a NanoPi R5S and I want(ed) to look at its gmac node as well,
because it (also) has some deprecated properties ... and
``phy-mode =3D "rgmii"`` which was done deliberately in commit
31425b1fadb2 ("arm64: dts: rockchip: fix gmac support for NanoPi R5S")
and the change was away from "rgmii-id" ... and it has a RTL8211F-CG.
Unfortunately the commit message doesn't say *why* it changed.

I also have a Quartz64-B, which also has a RTL8211F-CG and it has
``phy-mode =3D "rgmii"``, changed from "rgmii-id" in commit
16bc4d196b2a ("arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix ethernet on production Quartz64-B"=
)

And maybe related, but a bit different is the Quartz64-A which I also
have, which also has ``phy-mode =3D "rgmii"`` which I'm reasonably sure
was done deliberately (by Peter Geis, who also made the previously
mentioned commit for Q64-B). Q64-A's PHY is YT-8511C 'though'.

And then there's an 'issue' with Q64-A and Q64-B when U-Boot enabled the
ethernet driver causing massive packet loss:=20
https://lore.kernel.org/u-boot/2086393.9F9pDXStbY@bagend/
"configs: rockchip: Enable ethernet driver on RK356x boards"
(packet loss on Q64-B was significantly higher then on Q64-A)

As I said, it could be a coincidence and if it is, just tell me and I'll
stay out of this thread going further.
In any case, thanks for "Add informative text about RGMII delays", that
is quite useful :-)

Cheers,
  Diederik
