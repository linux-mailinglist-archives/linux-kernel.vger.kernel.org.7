I can do it, but I think it would make a good-first-issue so lets go
with that for now.

Not really shared with the C side, but with the `open` implementation in
`MiscDevice` that is (indirectly) called by C. (`UnsafeCell` will probably not be
needed, as `UnsafePinned` will almost certainly have `UnsafeCell` semantics in upstream).

Thinking about this has made me realize that the current code already is a bit
iffy, since `MiscDevice::open` gets `&MiscDeviceRegistration<Self>` as an argument. (It
should be fine since `UnsafeCell` and `UnsafePinned` semantics also apply to "parrent" types
i.e. `&MiscDeviceRegistration` also has the semantics of `Opaque`).

That would require a `Send` bound in the `register` function,
since a `MiscDevice` with `!Sync` `Data` would be valid now
(meaning that `MiscDeviceRegistration` may also be `!Sync`).

If you want I can go with that. I'm not really sure if its
really better (tough I don't feel that strongly either
way).

Alright I'll go with `Data` then.
