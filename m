Those are not as detailed as I'd like, as vendor builds seem to
override the default U-boot versioning rules (stripping the git hash
information off).

I've identified the following versions for the binary image that worked for=
 me:

DDR init v1.03 (version string "DDR 81dd75088a wesley.yao
24/04/16-11:19:41,fwver: v1.03")
U-boot SPL 2017.09 (no traces of any particular git commit, version
string "U-Boot SPL 2017.09 (Aug 23 2024 - 00:47:39)")

The build date is later than any commit I see in the ArmSoM repo
leading up to either of the two tags they have there ("rk3576" and
"rk3576-6.1-rk3.1", neither of them belonging to any published branch
there)

I've also noticed that ArmSoM SDK references the "boost" binary from
rkbin (rk3576_boost_v1.00.bin in particular), but it doesn't seem to
be present in the bootloader binary I'm looking at. The version string
of the SPL binary in rkbin as included in the SDK is also different
from what I'm seeing in the actual binary: SDK has "U-Boot SPL
2017.09-g57b8ceed1c3-240418 #lxh (Apr 19 2024 - 17:07:22), fwver:
v1.02".

I'll try and rebuild the vendor u-boot from source with these specific
versions of rkbin blobs (ddr v1.03, bl31 v1.04 and bl32 v1.01), but
the changelog in rkbin didn't mention anything that would seem
relevant to the issue I'm observing :(

Best regards,
Alexey
