Unless you take a lock explicitly, ftrace (and other pseudo
files) does not guarantee the consistency between 2 read()
syscalls, because it is something like a file which is shared
with kernel side.

Please imagine that this is something like a file shared
between two processes, one updating it and one reading it.
The kernel guarantees the one read() will consistent, but
two read()s may not be consistent because it can be updated
by another.

Can you make it for files which can be bigger than PAGE_SIZE?

For example, "hist" file also can be inconsistent if user reads
it several times. Can you also update it to return -EINVAL
if read buffer size is smaller?

Hmm, I'm still not convinced. If you redesign it, that should also
be applied to other pseudo files. "why tracefs can not read partially,
but procfs can?" I guess that can cause more confusion and will
lead unneeded debug.

Yeah, I like to update the document so that user must read with enough
size of buffer. And TIPs how to read consistent data from each file.
