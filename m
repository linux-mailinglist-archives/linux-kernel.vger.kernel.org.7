Sure, a test that hasn't completed hasn't succeeded, but it hasn't 
failed either, in the sense of there being no fault found in the actual 
code being tested. Hence it seems intuitive to me that reporting a 
failure in the test infrastructure itself as if it were incorrect 
behaviour of the target code is not right.

In this case AFAICS kunit_device_register() can only fail due to OOM or 
something unexpectedly messed up in the kobject/sysfs hierarchy, all of 
which should already scream (and represent the system being sufficiently 
hosed that any actual test results probably no longer matter anyway) - 
otherwise I would have suggested a kunit_err() message too.

Indeed I think this one ultimately wants to end up in an init function 
too once everything is unpicked, but for now...

The confusion is that most of those KUNIT_ASSERTs are where the KUnit 
API *is* the thing under test, or have clearly copy-pasted the same 
example soon after, and some are in init functions which could fail 
gracefully, so it's far from clear how much considered intent they 
actually represent. In fact AFAICS it's only the two cases of that exact 
pattern in overflow and fortify that hint at being an older notion.

However, on further inspection, I see that there also about as many of 
examples of kunit_skip() being used when failing to allocate per-test 
resources, so I guess that's the pattern I was after, hurrah! I wouldn't 
consider the difference between "test skipped because it unexpectedly 
couldn't run" and "test skipped because it knowingly wouldn't have been 
meaningful or possible to run" significant enough to be worth trying to 
split further.

Thanks,
Robin.
