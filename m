No, sorry for any confusion. I also noticed that some unwanted additional
lines slipped in my last reply, probably for a copy/paste mistake.

Let me explain...

The table above shows a real configuration copied from an x86 platform=20
where the Low Memory Hole (LMH) starts at 2GB.=20

The"HDM Decoder Base/Size" refers specifically to the CXL Endpoint=20
Decoders HPA range Base/Size. The first row of the table describes the=20
first window (CFMWS[0]), whose HPA rage base/size is 0/2GB, and the=20
Endpoint Decoder that the CXL driver should match with that CFMWS,=20
whose HPA range base/size is 0/3GB.

The Endpoint Decoder follows the 256MB x 12 interleave ways rule=20
mandated by the CXL specifications. Instead the CFMWS is truncated=20
immediately before the beginning of the LMH, because it needs to publish
only those memory locations that the system can address.  =20

Currently the CXL driver fails during the Region construction and=20
subsequent Endpoint Decoders attachment because it cannot match Root=20
Decoders (that are created with HPA ranges base/size equal to CFMWS)
and Switch Decoders with Endpoint decoders due to this size discrepancy.=20

The driver expects that the Endpoint Decoders HPA ranges to be contained=20
into their corresponding Root Decoders. Furthermore, Linux fails to=20
attach Endpoint decoders to already constructed CXL Regions because of=20
the same size discrepancy issue.=20

The expected behavior is that Linux should be able to match the Endpoint=20
Decoder with the Root Decoder range even if the CFMWS size is smaller=20
than the Decoder's, as long as the latter adheres to the 256MB * interleave=
=20
ways rule. Furthermore, Linux should be able to match the Endpoint decoders=
=20
with already constructed CXL Regions and allow the attachment process to=20
succeed.=20

This would enable the utilization of the 2GB memory described by CFMWS[0].

I hope this time I explained the LMH interference with CXL Regions=20
construction and Endpoint Decoders attachment with better clarity.

If this explanation suffices, I will incorporate it into the next version
of this patch and also explain that "HDM Decoder" stands for Endpoint Decod=
er=20
and that the CFMWS HPA base/size describes the System Physical Address (SPA=
)=20
which the CXL driver uses to make Root Decoders HPA range base/size.=20

Thanks,

=46abio
