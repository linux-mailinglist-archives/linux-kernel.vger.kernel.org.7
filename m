My bot found new DTB warnings on the .dts files added or changed in this
series.

Some warnings may be from an existing SoC .dtsi. Or perhaps the warnings
are fixed by another series. Ultimately, it is up to the platform
maintainer whether these warnings are acceptable or not. No need to reply
unless the platform maintainer has comments.

If you already ran DT checks and didn't see these error(s), then
make sure dt-schema is up to date:

  pip3 install dtschema --upgrade


This patch series was applied (using b4) to base:
 Base: using specified base-commit bc6e0ba6c9bafa6241b05524b9829808056ac4ad
 Deps: looking for dependencies matching 3 patch-ids
 Deps: Applying prerequisite patch: [PATCH v10 2/3] arm64: dts: qcom: Add qcs9075 IoT SOC devicetree
 Deps: Applying prerequisite patch: [PATCH v10 3/3] arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for qcs9075 IQ-9075-EVK

If this is not the correct base, please add 'base-commit' tag
(or use b4 which does this automatically)
