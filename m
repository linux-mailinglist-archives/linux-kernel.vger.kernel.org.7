With resctrl needing to support multiple architectures' way of doing things,
needing to support variety within an architecture just seems like another step.

Thank you for explaining this. This was not clear to me.

This is also an issue with this implementation, no? resctrl will not
allow creating more monitor groups than "1".

This is a concern since this means the interface becomes a "try and see"
for user space. As I understand a later statement the idea is that
"2" should be used by user space to know how many "mon_groups" directories
should be created to get telemetry support. To me this looks to be
a space that will create a lot of confusion. The moment user space
creates "2" + 1 "mon_groups" directories it becomes a guessing game
of what any new monitor group actually supports. After crossing that
threshold I do not see a good way for going back since if user space
removes one "mon_data" directory it does get back to "2" but then needs to
rely on resctrl internals or debugging to know for sure what the new
monitor group supports.

Could the next step be for the architecture to allow user space to
specify which hardware counters need to be assigned? With a new user
interface being created for such capability it may be worthwhile to
consider how it could be used/adapted for this feature. [1]

This only seems to address the "3" is less than "2" issue. It is not
so obvious to me that it should be treated as an erratum. Although,
I could not tell from your description how obvious this issue will be
to user space. For example, is it clear that if user space
gets *any* value then it is "good" and "Unavailable" means ... "Unavailable", or
could a returned value mean "this is partial data that was collected
during timeframe with hardware counter re-assigned at some point"?

I do not think that the "2" is less than "1" scenario should be 
ignored for reasons stated above and in review of this version.

What if we enhance resctrl's RMID assignment (setting aside for
a moment PMG assignment) to be directed by user space?

Below is an idea of an interface that can give user space 
control over what monitor groups are monitoring. This is very likely not
the ideal interface but I would like to present it as a start for
better ideas.

For example, monitor groups are by default created with most abundant
(and thus supporting fewest features on fewest resources) RMID.
The user is then presented with a new file (within each monitor group)
that lists all available features and which one(s) are active. For example,
let's consider hypothetical example where PERF_PKG perf has x RMID, PERF_PKG energy
has y RMID, and L3_MON has z RMID, with x < y < z. By default when user space
creates a monitor group resctrl will pick "abundant" RMID from range y + 1 to z
that only supports L3 monitoring:

# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_groups/m1/new_file_mon_resource_and_features
[L3]
PERF_PKG:energy
PERF_PKG:perf

In above case there will be *no* mon_PERF_PKG_XX directories in 
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_groups/m1/mon_data.

*If* user space wants perf/energy telemetry for this monitor
group then they can enable needed feature with clear understanding that
it is disruptive to all ongoing monitoring since a new RMID will be assigned.
For example, if user wants PERF_PKG:energy and PERF_PKG:perf then
user can do so with:

# echo PERF_PKG:perf > /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_groups/m1/new_file_mon_resource_and_features
# cat /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_groups/m1/new_file_mon_resource_and_features
[L3]
[PERF_PKG:energy]
[PERF_PKG:perf]

After the above all energy and perf files will appear in new mon_PERF_PKG_XX
directories.

User space can then have full control of what is monitored by which monitoring
group. If no RMIDs are available in a particular pool then user space can get
an "out of space" error and be the one to decide how it should be managed.

This also could be a way in which the "2" is larger than "1" scenario
can be addressed.

num_rmids is a source of complications. It does not have a good equivalent
for MPAM and there has been a few attempts at proposing alternatives that may
be worth keeping in mind while making changes here:

ps. I needed to go back an re-read the original cover-letter a couple of
times, while doing so I noticed one typo in the Background section: OOMMSM -> OOBMSM.
