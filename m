How is this kexecfs mount going to be restored into the container
view? Will we need to preserve fd_context in some global(?)
preservation way, i.e. in a root. Or is there a different way to
recreate fd_context upon reboot?

Yes, this is a very good property of using a file system.

LUO provides more than just resource preservation; it orchestrates the
serialization. While LUO can support various scenarios, let's use
virtual machines as an example.

The process involves distinct phases:

Before suspending a VM, the Virtual Machine Monitor may take actions
to quiesce the guest's activity. For example, it might temporarily
prevent guest reboots to avoid new DMA mappings or PCI device resets.
We refer to this preparatory, limited-functionality period as the
"brownout."

Following the brownout, LUO is transitioned into the PREPARED state.
This allows device states and other resources that require significant
time to serialize to be processed while the VMs are still running. For
most guests, this preparation period is unnoticeable.

Blackout: Once preparation is complete, the VMs are fully suspended in
memory, and the "blackout" period begins. The goal is to perform the
minimal required shutdown sequence and execute
reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC) as quickly as possible. During this
shutdown, the VMM process itself might or might not be terminated.
With FS approach it will have to stay alive in order to be preserved,
with liveupdated it can be terminated and the session in liveupdated
would carry the state into the kernel shutdown.

Restoration and Finish: After the new kernel boots, a userspace agent
like liveupdated would manage the preserved resources. It restores and
returns these resources to their respective VMMs or containers upon
request. Once all workloads have resumed, LUO is notified via the
FINISH event. LUO then cleans up any post live update state and
transitions the system back to the NORMAL state.

I am not against your proposal, it should be discussed, perhaps at the
hypervisor live update bi-weekly meeting.
