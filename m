It can be. I mentioned this in the cover letter but I understand if you
didn't read it. :)

I put it here in the displayport node because I wanted to represent that
this is the graph endpoint for displayport altmode. Otherwise, I'll have
to represent that with an endpoint in the usb-c-connector/port@1 node
that represents the SuperSpeed lanes, or do even more.

I was thinking about the case where PCIe is wired here as well for
thunderbolt altmode. If all the "DP stuff" is in one port then I can
pick the port@0 and follow endpoints from there. We don't have the PCIe
case on DT systems so it probably doesn't matter. If we had that case we
would probably add another endpoint to the usb-c-connector/port@1 to
represent that connection to the PCIe phy/controller anyway because I
suspect we wouldn't be able to steer the PCIe links physically. This
also helps to represent the analog mux we have on Trogdor that steers
the DP lanes to one or the other usb-c-connector.

I'm trying to represent the altmode muxing that happens with hardware
that the EC controls (i.e. not on the AP/Linux) along with describing
the connection between the usb-c-connector and the USB/DP controllers.
Basically 2 DP lanes and 2 USB SS lanes go into a muxing chip that the
EC controls and the output of that chip is 4 lanes of USB SS lanes that
go straight to the usb-c-connector with the proper orientation for the
pin configuration. Depending on the altmode that the EC enters on the
usb-c-connector, the 2 DP lanes pass through the EC to the connector, or
they're terminated at the muxing chip. If we controlled it from the
kernel the binding would look very much like the other bindings that
have 3 ports like you mention, 1 USB SS input and 1 DP input and a
single output for the usb-c-connector/port@1.

On some ARM chromebooks (e.g. Corsola), we have a DP transmitter that
wires 2 DP lanes to one usb-c-connector and 2 DP lanes to another
usb-c-connector. The graph is sort of like

 port0: AP DSI -> IT6505 DP_ML0/1 -> EC TCPC0 -> usb-c-connector@0
 port1: AP DSI -> IT6505 DP_ML2/3 -> EC TCPC1 -> usb-c-connector@1

where IT6505 can have two outputs in the graph, for either DP_ML0/1 or
DP_ML2/3. I imagine the graph for that device looks like this:

 ports {
   port@0 { // DSI input
   };
   port@1 { // DP output
     dp_ml01: endpoint@0 { // DP_ML0/1
       data-lanes =3D <0 1>;
     };
     dp_ml23: endpoint@1 {
       data-lanes =3D <2 3>;
     };
   };
 };

and the usb-c-connector accepts the DP endpoint:

 usb-c-connector@0 {
   altmodes {
     displayport {
       ports { endpoint { remote-endpoint =3D <&dp_ml01>; }; };
     };
 };
 usb-c-connector@1 {
   altmodes {
     displayport {
       ports { endpoint { remote-endpoint =3D <&dp_ml23>; }; };
     };
 };

On other ARM chromebooks (e.g. Trogdor) we have a DP transmitter that we
steer through an EC controlled analog mux. That looks like this:

 port0: AP DP -> EC mux -> EC TCPC0 -> usb-c-connector@0
 port1: AP DP -> EC mux -> EC TCPC1 -> usb-c-connector@1

where the AP DP binding looks like a single port

 port { ap_dp: endpoint { remote-endpoint =3D <&ec_dp>; };};

and the EC binding accepts that single port as input

 ports {
   port@0 {
     ec_dp: endpoint@0 {
       remote-endpoint =3D <&ap_dp>;
     };
     ec_dp0: endpoint@1 {
       remote-endpoint =3D <&dp_c0>;
     };
     ec_dp1: endpoint@2 {
       remote-endpoint =3D <&dp_c1>;
     };
   };
 };

and finally the connector takes an output endpoint from the DP "port"
into the altmode node.

 usb-c-connector@0 {
   altmodes {
     displayport {
       ports { dp_c0: endpoint { remote-endpoint =3D <&ec_dp0>; }; };
     };
 };
 usb-c-connector@1 {
   altmodes {
     displayport {
       ports { dp_c1: endpoint { remote-endpoint =3D <&ec_dp1>; }; };
     };
 };

I was thinking of making a drm_bridge for each usb-c-connector node and
for each DP input node in the EC typec node, then hotplugging the bridge
chain from the EC typec driver when the EC indicates the usb-c-connector
is in DP altmode. When we have a chip like IT6505 that means we make two
drm_bridges in the IT6505 driver, two in the EC typec driver, and one
for each usb-c-connector node (usually two). When we steer two DP lanes
with the EC, we have two drm_bridges in the EC typec driver and one for
each usb-c-connector node. The hotplug portion of the bridge chain only
goes to the EC in the latter case while it extends up to the IT6505 chip
in the former.

If we add endpoints for each altmode into the usb-c-connector/port@1
node then it may work without adding the intermediate EC graph, but I
worry about the Trogdor case. We could number the endpoints in the
connector like this:

usb-c-connector/port@1
   endpoint@0 =3D=3D USB SS (USB3)
   endpoint@1 =3D=3D DP lanes (DisplayPort)
   endpoint@2 =3D=3D TBT links (Thunderbolt)

but the DP controller only has one output port for the 2 DP lanes on
Trogdor, so we really need the graph binding in the EC just so that we
can have two graph output ports to connect to each usb-c-connector's
SuperSpeed port without changing the DP controller's binding.

TL;DR: I'm hesitant to add another endpoint into the usb-c-connector
graph's port@1 to handle alternate modes. It doesn't reflect reality. At
the same time, it looks verbose to describe the EC controlled TCPCs and
the mux. Ugh.

Now that I've written this all (thanks for reading!) I wonder if I
should bite the bullet and describe the TCPCs the EC controls as part of
the graph binding. If we did that it may be verbose but it would reflect
reality. Similarly, we can describe the EC mux on Trogdor as a single DP
input port. Maybe a graph binding like this would work in all cases:

 ec-typec {
   ports {
     port@0 { // DP mux input (only on Trogdor)
       endpoint {};
     };
     port@1 { // TCPC0
       endpoint@0 { // DP input (empty on Trogdor?)
       };
       endpoint@1 { // USB SS input
       };
       endpoint@2 { // PCIe input
       };
     };
     port@2 { // TCPC1
       endpoint@0 { // DP input (empty on Trogdor?)
       };
       endpoint@1 { // USB SS input
       };
     };
     // output starts at 9 =3D 1 + 8 possible connectors
     port@9 { // TCPC0 output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@0/port@1
     };
     port@10 { // TCPC1 output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@1/port@1
     };
   };
 };

or I need to make a whole new node for the DP mux that the EC controls
because the graph is getting gnarly:

 dp-mux { // Only on Trogdor
   mux-gpios =3D <&ec 42 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>>;
   ports {
     port@0 { // DP input
     };
     port@1 {
       mux_output0: endpoint { };
     };
     port@2 {
       mux_output1: endpoint { };
     };
   };
 };

 ec-typec {
   ports {
     port@0 { // TCPC0
       endpoint@0 { // DP input
         remote-endpoint =3D <&mux_output0> or <&dp_ml01>;
       };
       endpoint@1 { // USB SS input
       };
     };
     port@1 { // TCPC1
       endpoint@0 { // DP input
         remote-endpoint =3D <&mux_output1> or <&dp_ml23>;
       };
       endpoint@1 { // USB SS input
       };
     };
     port@8 { // TCPC0 output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@0/port@1
     };
     port@9 { // TCPC1 output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@1/port@1
     };
   };
   usb-c-connector@0 { };
   usb-c-connector@1 { };
 };

Any binding that relies on having multiple DP input endpoints in the
same ports node will require the ability to register more than one
drm_bridge for the same parent node. I haven't checked to see if that's
possible with the hotplug bridge patches. If it isn't, then we'll
possibly want to describe each TCPC as a different node as well so that
a drm_bridge can be associated with a graph node parent device.

 tcpc0 {
   ports {
     port@0 { // DP input
       endpoint {
         remote-endpoint =3D <&mux_output0> or <&dp_ml01>;
       };
     };
     port@1 { // USB SS input
       endpoint {
       };
     };
     port@2 { // USB type-c output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@0/port@1
     };
   };
 };

 tcpc1 {
   ports {
     port@0 { // DP input
       endpoint {
         remote-endpoint =3D <&mux_output1> or <&dp_ml23>;
       };
     };
     port@1 { // USB SS input
       endpoint {
       };
     };
     port@2 { // USB type-c output
       endpoint { }; // To usb-c-connector@1/port@1
     };
   };
 };

 ec-typec {
   usb-c-connector@0 { };
   usb-c-connector@1 { };
 };

In this last example, a drm_bridge is made for each tcpc,
usb-c-connector, and mux node. Any direction you can provide? Maybe this
last one is the best approach that doesn't suffer from trying to cram
everything into the typec node.
