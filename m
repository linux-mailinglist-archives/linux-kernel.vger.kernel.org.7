OK, just to clarify, the subsystem I linked above is not a bus, it's an
internal API. Think GPIO or PWM. The devices typically live on an MDIO
bus (although a platform bus wouldn't be out of the question). So it's
"not our job" to load the module; that should be done by the bus. From
our perspective, if we look up a device and it's not there we don't
really know if it's ever going to show up.

Regarding the auxiliary bus, I tried it out and it works. The conversion
is around +50 lines, which is not ideal. Ideally I would like to push
complexity into subsystem code rather than making drivers deal with it,
but I don't really see a good way to do this in the subsystem. There are
just a lot of assumptions along the line of "when you register the
device you must know what capabilities it supports." For example, fixed
links (MAC to MAC) are validated when the phylink is created and the
whole process fails if there's an incompatibility. Which can occur if
the late-binding component is the thing that adds support for the fixed
link.
