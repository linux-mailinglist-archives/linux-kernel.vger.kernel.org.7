Ah, that's right. The example wasn't updated there. Thank you! =)

In this case, the secondary OLDI (oldi1) would remain disabled from
soc.dtsi.

I gave this a quick try. Turns out, of_parse_phandle() is not able to
return an error when primary OLDI tries to find a companion -- which is
important for the driver to detect an absence of any secondary OLDI.

Since the driver code registers a companion for primary OLDI, and
further does not find the "dual-lvds-{odd,even}-pixels" properties,
the driver ends up trying for a Clone Mode.

So, for single-link , we'd have to actively delete the "companion-oldi"
property, in the board.dts/panel.dtso.


But, say, the disabled-node's phandle parse is circumvented, somehow,
and we don't need to delete the property explicitly.

There would still be one concern, I am afraid.

In AM67A DSS (future scope at the moment), the 2 OLDIs can act
independently. Like a 2x Independent Single-Link. Both the OLDI dt nodes
will be enabled.

So, if the soc.dtsi has them already connected, then the
board.dts/panel.dtso would still need to explicitly delete those
properties to get the 2 OLDI TXes to work independently.
