The problem is deeper. This is default behaviour of get_maintainer digging
into the Git history. In the past people were complaining (a lot in some cases)
that they were included in the threads by a mistake because they made cosmetic
patches or the treewide change while not being interested _at all_ in looking
after the certain file / driver. So, with --no-git-fallback it gives nothing,
expect LKML.

See also above. Depending on the options it may still give bad result w.o.
explicit mention in the MAINTAINERS (or via glob).

Sure, thanks ahead!

I just sent a v2 without the first patch.

Thanks for review!
