I think this would be problematic too.

Think of the client example I gave above: Let's assume a driver creates a
'client' directory for every bound device and we create a single file per client
connecting to the corresponding device exposed to userspace.

Let's assume clients do connect and disconnect frequently. If we'd allow
file.leak() in this case, it would mean that all the private data of the clients
that have ever been connected piles up in the 'client' directories's private
data storage until the 'client' directory is removed, which is when the device
is unbound, which might be never.

Yeah, let's not have file.leak() either.
