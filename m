After some more testing, I tend to confirm what Piotr observed
earlier. Namely, frequency scaling acts weird on any ATF version (be
it binary BL31 or opensource TF-A), as long as mainline u-boot is
used. Using the u-boot binary extracted from the ArmSoM QWRT image
does not lead to "stuck" CPU frequencies when running sbc-bench.

I'm getting this with the exact same kernel build (6.16-rc1 with some
Sige5 related patches, namely v2 of this series, Nicolas' USB
enablement series and TSADC). The only other difference is that the
binary u-boot doesn't have EFI support, so I had to boot into the
ARM64 uncompressed Image instead of vmlinuz.efi, but those were both
taken from the same build.

What I'm observing during the sbc-bench run:
 - It switches the cpufreq governor from schedutil to performance
 - It goes through all CPU OPPs in descending frequency order
 --- While it does that when booted using mainline u-boot +
vmlinuz.efi: "hardware limits" line in "cpupower -c 0,4
frequency-info" changes with each OPP change (the max frequency
getting reduced sequentially), then it resets to the initial full
range, but the actual frequency stays stuck at the lowest possible
value
 --- While it does that when booted using binary u-boot + Image:
"hardware limits" line in "cpupower -c 0,4 frequency-info" doesn't
change, but the actual frequency gets reduced sequentially. Then after
the iteration over all OPPs is completed it returns to the highest
possible value, and adjusts dynamically based on thermal throttling as
the benchmark progresses

So it seems that it's not really linked to SCMI clocks or PVTPLL per
se, but rather what the binary u-boot configures differently vs.
mainline before the kernel takes over, or something in other firmware
services that the binary u-boot provides (?)

I'm wondering if there is any clock related functionality in the
OP-TEE? I didn't have any OP-TEE image in my mainline u-boot builds
(frankly, I don't even know where to grab one), but the binary u-boot
from ArmSoM advertises the following:

I/TC: OP-TEE version: 3.13.0-791-g185dc3c92 #hisping.lin (gcc version
10.2.1 20201103 (GNU Toolchain for the A-profile Architecture
10.2-2020.11 (arm-10.16))) #2 Tue Apr 16 11:05:25 CST 2024 aarch64,
fwver: v1.01

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Best regards,
Alexey
