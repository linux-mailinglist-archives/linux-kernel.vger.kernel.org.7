I've been summoned.

As raised in the past, I would initially only support specific values here like

0 				  : Never collapse with any pte_none/zeropage
511 (HPAGE_PMD_NR - 1) / default  : Always collapse, ignoring pte_none/zeropage

Once could also easily support the value 255 (HPAGE_PMD_NR / 2- 1), but not sure
if we have to add that for now.

Because, as raised in the past, I'm afraid nobody on this earth has a clue how
to set this parameter to values different to 0 (don't waste memory with khugepaged)
and 511 (page fault behavior).


If any other value is set, essentially
	pr_warn("Unsupported 'max_ptes_none' value for mTHP collapse");

for now and just disable it.
