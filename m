Please send a V3 where you include a reference to SAT-6 (revision 2),
"11 Translation of ATA errors to SCSI errors" in the commit message.

Agreed, let's just set it unconditionally for now, and if there ever comes
a command that wants to use the INFORMATION field for something else
(which seems unlikely), we can simply special case that command.

However, please mention this in the commit message as well.

We can have sense data for both SCSI status codes GOOD and CHECK CONDITION.
I'm not really a big fan that the sense data is not the same (does not
include the INFORMATION field) for these cases.

The logical thing would be, either we have sense data or not, and if we do,
the sense data has the same amount of information.

You do mention the footnote that the SCSI INFORMATION field should be set
to the ATA LBA field
"From ATA error outputs (non-NCQ) or ATA NCQ Command Error log"

If we look at the ATA NCQ Command Error log, it does have LBA field,
but no INFORMATION field.

If we look at the ATA Sense Data for Successful NCQ Commands log,
it has a bunch of Sense Data descriptors.

ACS-6, 9.29.3 Successful Sense Data descriptor,
does have the LBA field and an INFORMATION field.

The definition of the INFORMATION field in the Successful Sense Data
descriptor:

"""
9.29.3.5 INFORMATION field
If definition of the sense data to be returned when a command completes
without an error includes an information value, then the INFORMATION field
contains the defined value. Otherwise, the INFORMATION field is reserved.
"""

Thus, I do think that the most correct thing, for Successful NCQ commands
with sense data, is to fill in the SCSI INFORMATION field to the INFORMATION
field from the Successful Sense Data descriptor.

Not sure how to deal with non-NCQ Successful commands... The spec writers
do make our lives interesting by providing different amount of information
depending on the method used to get the sense data :)


Kind regards,
Niklas
