You can exclude registers from a cache, including excluding most of
them, or manually handle registers over suspend/resume.  It's generally
better to share the userspace facing interfaces.

If the different devices have different controls you should just
register different controls.

You're not just restoring the values on resume, you're also overwriting
them on probe.

That doesn't really answer the question?

All the power management happens after hw_params(), this isn't an issue.

There's not great options here, and you're going to loose the start of
playback especially with devices that don't start clocking until audio
starts.  You really need the CPU vendors you're working with to
implement SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CONT or expose their clocks via the clock API
but not all hardware is able to do this.  I think given how limited your
hardware is here you really need something in trigger() or some new
callback that runs later than that, the delayed work you've got there is
trying to fudge things to run after trigger.

If they don't happen in normal operation it's fine to have them, the
concern was that this would be triggered during normal operation as part
of the startup or shutdown sequence.

I suspect the DT people won't like that since it's more of a tuning
thing.

What if for example playback is starting up at the same time as the
system enters suspend - the CODEC startup might get run after the
delayed work is cancelled but before the lock is taken.
