Briefly spoke to Greg (now Cc:ed).  We can all discuss this together.

My 2c, whilst falling short of deep-diving, is as follows:

1. No one is going to enjoy reviewing a 3k line submission!

   - Instead, submit the smallest driver you can whilst still retaining
     functionality.  It is not good practice to fully enable a
     complicated driver such as this in a single submission - let alone
     a single patch.

2. Hand-rolling your own API from scratch is to be highly discouraged.

   - There seems to be quite a bit of overlap in functionality between
     your bespoke API and LED's.  The LED subsystem already supports a
     lot of what's being implemented here.  Instead of letting the user
     configure the device directly, why not offer some high level
     options and attempt to infer the rest.  If possible, the complexity
     of the device should be handed by driver, rather than placing the
     onus on the user.

3. Shoving this into Misc because you don't want to use the APIs that
   are already offered to you is not a good approach.
