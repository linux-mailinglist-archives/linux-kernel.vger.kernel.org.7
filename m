I think the latest progress should be here: [0]. It seems that it hasn't 
been updated for a while.

That makes sense, but this might make the DP driver quite complex. I 
will see if I can make it happen.

Sorry, I still don't quite understand your point. I think the entire 
notification path is as follows:

Type-C mux callback -> RK3399 USBDP PHY -> PHY calls 
drm_connector_oob_hotplug_event() -> DP driver

Are you concerned that the IRQ_HPD event is not being handled somewhere 
along the path? Is it that the Type-C mux callback didn't notify the 
PHY, or that after the PHY passed the event to the DP driver via the OOB 
event, the DP driver didn't handle it?
