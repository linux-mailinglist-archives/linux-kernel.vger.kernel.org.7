The __symbols__ based approach needs 2 overlays to handle the case where
2 connectors (A and B) are present an you want to connect a board described
by a single overlay.

The first overlay applied "adapts" the __symbols__ node for the connector
where the board is connected (for instance connector A) in order to have
the symbols used by the overlay describing the board resolved to the
correct symbols.

I think this open race conditions when the overlay is applied by the kernel
itself. Indeed, we need to perform 2 steps in an atomic way:
  1) Adapt symbols
  2) Applied board overlay

Also, a 3rd step should be added to restore symbols modified to their
original value after the overlay is applied. This should be done to avoid
any symbols collision.

An other negative point is that properties in __symbols__ node are not
described by device-tree bindings.
How can we ensure interoperability between different base board.

The export-symbols node is a node fully described in the DT and it is
a sub-node of a connector node. This connector node has compatible string
and a binding describing its own property and sub-nodes. Among them, the
export-symbols node is described and can be checks by dt_binding_check.

This implies that whatever the base board, for a given connector type
(compatible string) the properties inside the export-symbols node have the
exact same name. Any addon board overlay designed for this connector type
will apply whatever the system where this connector is soldered.

With existing infrastructure in the kernel, it leads to memory leaks if you
add or change a property in an existing node.

In other word, each time you update a symbol in the __symbols__ node, you
have a memory leak.

request_firmware() or the firmware upload feature (CONFIG_FW_UPLOAD) could
also be used if the connector is seen as a specific device and has a driver.

It depends on the bus the device is added.
when an overlay is applied by the kernel, OF_RECONFIG_* events are
triggered. Some buses handle them:

	$ git grep OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE
	drivers/bus/imx-weim.c: case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD:
	drivers/bus/imx-weim.c: case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE:
	drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:      case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD:
	drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c:      case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE:
	drivers/i2c/i2c-core-of.c:      case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD:
	drivers/i2c/i2c-core-of.c:      case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE:
	drivers/of/dynamic.c: * Return: OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE on device going from enabled to
	drivers/of/dynamic.c: * disabled, OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD on device going from disabled to
	drivers/of/dynamic.c:   return new_state ? OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD : OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE;
	drivers/of/platform.c:  case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_ADD:
	drivers/of/platform.c:  case OF_RECONFIG_CHANGE_REMOVE:

I wouldn't say 'a lot'.
I already did the work for I2C bus extension [0] and the implementation was
not so complex.

Again, thanks again for initiating this discussion.
Hope this will help to move forward on this topic!
