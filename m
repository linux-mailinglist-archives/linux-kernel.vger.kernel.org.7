I think it's not necessary to find a way to disable madvise_collapse. 
Essentially, it's a conflict between the semantics of madvise_collapse 
and the '/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' interface. We 
should reach a consensus on the semantics first:

Semantic 1: madv_collapse() should ignore any THP system settings, 
meaning we need to update the 'never' semantics in 
'/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled', which would only disable 
page fault and khugepaged, not including madvise_collapse. If we agree 
on this, then the 'never' for per-sized mTHP would have the same 
semantics, i.e., when I set 64K mTHP to 'always' and 2M mTHP to 'never', 
madvise_collapse would still allow the collapse of 2M THP. We should 
document this clearly in case users still want 64K mTHP from 
madvise_collapse.


Semantic 2: madv_collapse() needs to respect THP system settings, which 
is what my patch does. Never means never, and we would need to update 
the documentation of madv_collapse() to make it clearer.

Yes, agree.

We should not collapse 512MB THP on 64K pagesize kernel. So seems 
madv_collapse() can not work on 64K pagesize kernel.

Great. Thanks.

Yes. Agree. Will be another mess I guess :)

Yes.
