Sure, it's an automounter bug; or an fsck bug, assuming that their
system is running fsck -y on the file system before trying to mount
the file system.

So if you can come up with a reproducer that *starts* with a valid
file system which passes fsck, and then using normal, non-root
operations, you can corrupt the file system and then trigger a kernel
crash or some vulnerability, then that's a valid security bug in my
opinion.  I'll certainly treat it that way for ext4.

But you need to demonstrate this using a reproducer that doesn't start
with a fuzzed file system.  In my experience, this rules out 99% of
syzbot bugs reported against ext4.  But if you can come up with such a
reproducer, send the POC to the file system developer, and ask them to
address it.  If it's against ext4, I'll get on it right away.

Great, but that's not this CVE.  Note that it was entitled "... with
manually crafted filesystem"
