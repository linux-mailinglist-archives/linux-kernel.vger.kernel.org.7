Thanks for the info.

Yunjeong and I have been involved in finding the problem and also concluded this
issue is related to hotplug together with our initial implementations before
this patch.  So I guess it is the former case.

It looks the below order is correct.  I saw this order in the official document
example as well.

Rakie already asked him and he will update signinig tags at the next spin.
Thanks very much for your help!
