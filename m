I get what you're saying, I really do. I'm actually in the "playing
Wack-A-Mole(tm) is far better than generating code that accidentally
launches the nukes" crowd. The fact that the compiler silently
generates something wrong is horrifying to me. The compiler has a ton
of options to allow for "bad" math, but they're mostly (all?) for
floating point operations. It has some for integers, like the -fwrapv
you mentioned.

I'll see what I can do with this. I might be able to sneak a patch in
past the religious nutcases. The fact that we have the two flags
Nathan and I mentioned could indicate that someone will be amenable to
the patch.
