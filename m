OK. Thanks for the explanation.

This design principle surprised me a bit, and I failed to find the 
reason in the commit log. I agree that "never should mean never," and we 
should respect the THP/mTHP sysfs setting. Additionally, for the 
'shmem_enabled' sysfs interface controlled for shmem/tmpfs, THP collapse 
can still be prohibited through the 'deny' configuration. The rules here 
are somewhat confusing.

I don't think we need this exception, unless there is some solid reason.
