I don't think so:

The answers related to the errors encountered during DTC compilation:

https://lore.kernel.org/oe-kbuild-all/CABGWkvp7n=3DOr-OqnLoOJsQQCHF+=3D8eQ9=
EV5=3DO+Qp4sQF49_DbA@mail.gmail.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CABGWkvqfyH=3Ddcuw6EDZaFVVebj8SZhJF0P944+mmzL5Y=
K3-Pug@mail.gmail.com/

The patch to fix the regression reported by Mark Brown:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250516134945.14692-1-dario.binacchi@amarulaso=
lutions.com/

Also successfully tested by him.

And when I didn=E2=80=99t reply, I was expecting the maintainers to handle =
it
=E2=80=94 as Peng Fan had requested in version 10:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250314093503.GD12210@nxa18884-linux/

I may have made some mistakes, but don't tell me I never replied.

After all, anyone can make mistakes:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/d421a6e8-e72c-48d9-8806-09724723b5d8@kernel.org=
/
