 This is obviously a false image.  The most recent MIPS ISAs, such as the 
microMIPSr6 or the nanoMIPS architecture, and consequently implementations 
were absolutely RISC-V-like, with branch delay slots removed, conditional 
moves replaced with conditional selects, floating-point condition codes 
removed in favour to setting a general register, PC-relative instructions 
added and overall being a variable-length compressed instruction set, up 
to the point for some company engineers to become disgruntled with the ISA 
"losing the MIPS spirit."  So it's not that they can't be bothered to make 
a full proper RISC-V core, surely they can.

 The thing is based on my experience I'm fairly sure it's all just driven 
by company customers, which have their legacy MIPS code base or whatever 
and want to switch with minimum effort.  And for a hardware company to 
support a customer it's obviously easier to tweak hardware rather than 
software.

 NB I doubt it's about peripherals: dropping a different CPU into an 
existing system is nothing new and does not require the ISAs involved to 
be remotely similar to each other; cf. VAX vs Alpha for example.

 Whether we're going to accept things dumped onto us is another matter.  
There's plenty of code downstream that hasn't made it here, and going back 
to my examples, we've never got microMIPSr6 support in Linux even though 
it used to live downstream, and attempts continue being made to get this 
stuff upstreamed across the board.  We may or may not choose to accept 
bits that make our life tougher, and there have been precedents across 
free software, such as the RS6000/PowerPC GCC backend maintainer refusing 
to take changes adding support for the VLE instruction set.

 FYI and FWIW,
