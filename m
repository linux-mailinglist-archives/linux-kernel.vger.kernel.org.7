I don't see why the write lock matters since pud_free_pmd_page() doesn't
take the read lock in the second scenario. What we need is acquire
semantics after the static branch update on the ptdump path but we get
it before we even attempt the write lock.

For simplicity, ignoring the observability of instruction writes and
considering the static branch a variable, if pud_free_pmd_page() did not
observe the static branch update, is the ptdump guaranteed to see the
cleared pud subsequently?

With initial state pud=1 (non-zero), stb=0 (static branch):

P0 (pud_free_pmd_page)		P1 (ptdump)

    W_pud=0			   W_stb=1
    DSB				   barrier/acq
    R_stb=0			   R_pud=?

The write to the static branch on P1 will be ordered after the read of
the branch on P0, so the pud will be seen as 0. It's not even worth
mentioning the semaphore here as the static branch update has enough
barriers for cache flushing and kick_all_cpus_sync().


The other scenario is P0 (pud_free_pmd_page) observing the write to the
static branch (that's case 1 in your comment). This doesn't say anything
about whether P1 (ptdump) sees a clear or valid pud. What we do know is
that P0 will try to acquire (and release) the lock. If P1 already
acquired the write lock, P0 will wait and the state of the pud is
irrelevant (no freeing). Similarly if P1 already completed by the time
P0 takes the lock.

If P0 takes the lock first, the lock release guarantees that the
pud_clear() is seen by the ptdump code _after_ it acquired the lock.


W.r.t. the visibility of the branch update vs pud access, the
combinations of DSB+ISB (part of the TLB flushing) on P0 and cache
maintenance to PoU together with kick_all_cpus_sync() on P1 should
suffice.

I think the logic works (though I'm heavily jetlagged and writing from a
plane) but the comments need to be improved. As described above, case 1
has two sub-cases depending on when P0 runs in relation to the write
lock (before or during/after). And the write lock doesn't matter for
case 2.

Neither did I ;) (mostly analogue electronics). I was thinking something
like our cat/herd tools where you can write some simple assembly. It's a
good investment if you want to give it a try.
