Another thing to note is that memory layout - avoiding pointer chasing -
is hugely important, but it'll almost never show up as allocator calls.

To give you some examples, mempools and biosets used to be separately
allocated. This was mainly to make error paths in outer object
constructors/destructors easier and safer: instead of keeping track of
what's initialized and what's not, if you've got a pointer to a
mempool/bioset you call *_free() on it.

(People hadn't yet clued that you can just kzalloc() the entire outer
object, and then if the inner object is zeroed it wasn't initialized).

But that means you're adding a pointer chase to every mempool_alloc()
call, and since bioset itself has mempools allocating bios had _two_
unnecessary pointer derefs. That's death for performance when you're
running cache cold, but since everyone benchmarks cache-hot...

(I was the one who fixed that).

Another big one was generic_file_buffered_read(). Main buffered read
path, everyone wants it to be as fast as possible.

But the core is (was) a loop that walks the pagecache radix tree to get
the page, then copies 4k of data out to userspace (there goes l1), then
repeats all that pointer chasing for the next 4k. Pre large folios, it
was horrific.

Solution - vectorize it. Look up all the pages we're copying from all at
once, stuff them in a (dynamically allocated! for each read!) vector,
and then do the copying out to userspace all at once. Massive
performance gain.

Of course, to do that I first had to clean up a tangled 250+ line
monstrosity of half baked, poorly thought out "optimizations" (the worst
spaghetti of gotos you'd ever seen) and turn it into something
manageable...

So - keep things simple, don't overthink the little stuff, so you can
spot and tackle the big algorithmic wins :)
