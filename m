Right, so we're in a bad situation now because we didn't listen. That 
sucks and I'm sorry.

How do we move on from here now though?

I think for any new bindings it's pretty clear, we just do what we 
should've done from the very beginning:
Whenever we upstream a new device that has no bindings yet we only use 
tXXXX-whatever as compatible and use that as a fallback in case later 
(or earlier) SoCs work with the same driver.



Then we still have to deal with the stuff that's already upstream. I see 
two options here:


1) For situations like this one where the generic one just doesn't make 
any sense we deprecate "apple,nvme-ans2" in the binding and use
"apple,t8103-nvme-ans2" as the fallback instead, i.e. just
"apple,t8103-nvme-ans2" for M1, "apple,t6000-nvme-ans2", 
"apple,t8103-nvme-ans2" for M1 Pro, and just "apple,t8015-nvme-ans2" for 
A11.

We keep the generic one in the driver for now but also add
"apple,t8103-nvme-ans2". We then remove the generic one from all 
upstream DTS files but keep it inside the downstream files we ship to 
users for now to avoid pain with kernel upgrades/downgrades.
A year or two from now we can then delete the deprecated generic 
compatibles everywhere. This all has to be synced with OpenBSD and 
u-boot as well since both also use these bindings.
It's gonna be rather painful but this would clean up the entire mess.


2) We keep using the ones that are already upstream and just accept that 
the situation is a mess and add comment above all the bindings that we 
messed up and that this should not be used as pattern.
In this case that means it'll just be "apple,t8015-nvme-ans2" for A11 
without any fallback and we keep everything else the way it is.

I prefer option (2) but if you really want to get rid of all this mess 
I'll also work on (1).

Would either option work for you or do you have a better idea?



Thanks,


Sven
