Hi Yixun,

So, here is my proposed plan: I will submit two patches. The first
patch will introduce the dma-bus node and move the relevant (uart0, uart2
..uart9) device nodes under it. The second patch will then add the pdma0
node itself. Please let me know if you have a different approach in mind.

Maybe you want to see an independent patchset with just the first patch? Th=
is
way it can be merged early without waiting for the pdma0 series.
Let me know. Thanks.

On a side note, you mentioned I2C. I searched for upstream I2C DTS nodes
for the K1 but couldn't find any. I checked the for-next/dt-for-next
branches in the spacemit-com/linux.git repository. Did I miss something?

BR,
Guodong
