Hi Lorenzo,

follow up or loose dependency. Not sure the correct terminology.

Either way, as I was developing this as a potential solution for the
THP internal fragmentation issue, upstream was working on adding
mTHPs. By adding a new THP sysctl entry I noticed mTHP would now be
missing the same entry. Furthermore I was told mTHP support for
khugepaged was a desire, so I began working on it in conjunction. So
given the undefined behavior of defer globally while any mix of mTHP
settings, it became dependent on the khugepaged support. Either way
patch 1 of this series is the core functionality. The rest is to fill
the undefined behavior gap.

This could technically get merged without the mTHP khugepaged changes,
but then the reviews would probably all be pointing out what I pointed
out above. Chicken or Egg problem...

Nope we've already discussed this in both the MM alignment and thp
upstream meetings, no one was opposing it, and a lot of testing was
done-- by me, RH's CI, and our perf teams. Ive posted several RFCs
before posting a patchset.

Hopefully paragraph one clears this up! They were built in
conjunction, but posting them as one series didn't feel right (and
IIRC this was also discussed, and this was decided).

Most of the testing was done in conjunction, but independent testing
was also done on this series (including by a large customer that was
itching to try the changes, and they were very satisfied with the
results).
