In case you didn't spot it, cpu_read_midr() is not actually reading a remote
cpu's midr. It's reading the cached midr in a per-cpu data structure. So I don't
think this will be very expensive in reality. And it's only run once during boot...

static inline unsigned int cpu_read_midr(int cpu)
{
	WARN_ON_ONCE(!cpu_online(cpu));

	return per_cpu(cpu_data, cpu).reg_midr;
}

For BBML3, we're looking for a minimum value in the BBM field of the FFMR, and
in that case the framework can handle it nicely with
ARM64_CPUCAP_SYSTEM_FEATURE. But the framework doesn't have any support for the
case where we need to look at all the midrs. So Suzuki came up with this method.

If/when we have BBML3 I was thinking we could retrospectively treat the CPUs in
the midr list as having an erratum that they don't advertise BBML3 when they
should (since the semantics are basically the same I expect/hope/have been
trying to ensure), so we can just implement workarounds to make it look like
they do have BBML3, then the framework does it's thing. Perhaps we can live with
this hack until we get to that point?

Agreed.

That's exactly the policy that this cludge provides. But it's using the midr to
check if the CPU has BBML2_NOABORT. I'm not sure I follow your point about a
"BBM_CONFLICT_ABORT" erratum?

I'm also at a massive disadvantage because I find the whole cpufeatures
framework impenetrable :)

I'll ping Suzuki to see if he can chime in here.

Thanks,
