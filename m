The PERF_LEVEL_GET comment? That one is correct, right? :)

Yeah, it goes both ways. Getting the quirk implementation out of the way
makes it easier to follow the normal flow, but also makes it a bit
harder to review the quirk. Your implementation may be a good trade-off.

Perhaps there's some way to get the quirk code always compiled but
discarded when CONFIG_ARM_SCMI_QUIRKS is disabled (e.g. by using
IS_ENABLED() in the macro)?

CONFIG_ARM_SCMI_QUIRKS may also need to be enabled by default as it can
be hard to track down random crashes to a missing quirk.

We don't seem to have a subvendor here and if IIUC the version has not
been bumped (yet) after fixing the FC issue.

Right, in this case it would probably be OK.

But what if the version is bumped for some other reason (e.g. before a
bug has been identified)? Then you'd currently need an entry for each
affected revision or does the implementation assume it applies to
anything <= ImplVersion? Do we want to add support for version ranges?
