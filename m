That's great, but I don't think that's what sysfs is good for, we can
discuss that later when you submit your driver for review.

Again, look at configfs please, that's for "configuring" things.  sysfs
is for basic device properties and some tunables, but is NOT a major api
interface that requires a lot of logic like loading an overlay would
require.

Also, circumventing the "normal" device tree overlay interface and
discussion isn't ok either, this needs to work for all types of devices,
not just for "capes" like you have here.  To accept something like this
would be going around all of those other maintainers with their strong
views of how things should be done.

Anyway, we can discuss that when you submit your code for review, but
for now, I don't want to take this binding either as I think the whole
function should just be removed from the kernel anyway :)

thanks,
