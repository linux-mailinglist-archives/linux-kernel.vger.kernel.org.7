Yes, that makes sense.

Instead of using the dentry pointer as a handle, we could also use the entry's
path and do a lookup whenever the entry is used. Not saying this is better
though.

Well, take the case I described above, where the debugfs "root" is created in
the module scope, but subsequent entries are created by driver instances. If a
driver would use keep() in such a case, we'd effectively the file / directory
(and subsequently also the corresponding memory) everytime a device is unplugged
(or unbound in general)."

If the module is built-in the directory from the module scope is *never*
removed, but the entries the driver e.g. creates in probe() for a particular
device with keep() will pile up endlessly, especially for hot-pluggable devices.

(It's getting even worse when there's data bound to such a leaked file, that
might even contain a vtable that is entered from any of the fops of the file.)

That'd be clearly a bug, but for the driver author calling keep() seems like a
valid thing to do -- to me that's clearly a built-in footgun.
