Yes but the loop would read 'some_value' again, fold in 'futex' and
retry. It would eventually succeed or fail after 128 iterations if the
user keeps changing that location. Note that's also the case with LL/SC,
the exclusive monitor would be cleared by some store in the same cache
line (well, depending on the hardware implementation) and the STXR fail.
From this perspective, CAS has better chance of succeeding.

I think the code would look simpler with LL/SC but you can give it a try
and post the code sample here (not in a new series).

BTW, is there a test suite for all the futex operations? The cover
letter did not mention any.
