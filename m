One concrete feature is the use of Arm's FEAT_BBM level 2 to avoid having to do
break-before-make and TLB maintenance when doing a fold or unfold operation.
There is a series in flight to add this support at [1]. I can see this type of
approach being extended to the hugetlb helpers in future.

I also have another series in flight at [2] that tidies up the hugetlb
implementation and does some optimizations. But the optimizations depend on
arm64-specific TLB maintenance APIs.

As for errata, that's obviously much more fuzzy; there have been a bunch
relating to the MMU in the recent past, and I wouldn't be shocked if more turned up.

For future architecture enchancements, I'm aware of one potential feature being
discussed for which this change would likely make it harder to implement.

OK if that's your preference, I'm ok with it. I don't have strong opinion, just
a sense that we will end up with loads of arch-specific overrides. As you say,
let's see.

Alexandre, I guess this series is quite old now and will need to incorporate the
hugtelb fixes I did last cycle? And ideally I'd like [2] to land then for that
to also be incorporated into your next version. (I'm still hopeful we can get
[2] into v6.16 and have been waiting patiently for Will to pick it up ;) ).

I guess we can worry about [1] later as that is only affected by your other series.

How does that sound?

That's fine with me. Lorenzo added me for some parts of MM this cycle anyway.

Thanks,
