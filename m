READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() rely on the volatile keyword, which serves
two main purposes:

1. It tells the compiler that the variable's value can change unexpectedly,
    preventing the compiler from making incorrect optimizations based on
    assumptions about its stability.

2. It ensures the CPU directly reads from or writes to the variable's
    memory address. This means the value will be fetched from cache (L1/L2)
    if available, or from main memory otherwise, rather than using a stale
    value from a CPU register.

smp_load_acquire() / smp_store_release() guarantee that CPUs read the
latest data.

For example, imagine a variable a = 0, with both CPU0 and CPU1 having
a=0 in their caches.

Without a memory barrier:
When CPU0 executes WRITE_ONCE(a, 1), a=1 is written to the store buffer,
an RFO is broadcast, and CPU0 continues other tasks. After receiving ACKs,
a=1 is written to main memory and becomes visible to other CPUs.
Then, if CPU1 executes READ_ONCE(a), it receives the RFO and adds it to
its invalidation queue. However, it might not process it immediately;
instead, it could perform the read first, potentially still reading a=0
from its cache.

With a memory barrier:
When CPU0 executes smp_store_release(&a, 1), a=1 is not only written to
the store buffer, but data in the store buffer is also written to main
memory. An RFO is then broadcast, and CPU0 waits for ACKs from all CPUs.

When CPU1 executes smp_load_acquire(a), it receives the RFO and adds it
to its invalidation queue. Here, the invalidation queue is flushed, which
invalidates a in CPU1's cache. CPU1 then replies with an ACK, and when it
performs the read, its cache is invalid, so it reads the latest a=1 from
main memory.

This is a general overview. Please let me know if I've missed anything.
