The crypto_shash API is synchronous and operates on virtual addresses.  So it
just provides a simple way to support multiple hash algorithms, and none of the
legacy asynchronous hardware offload stuff.  It's crypto_ahash that has that.

Multibuffer hashing (interleaving multiple hashes) is CPU-based, and it requires
that all the lengths be synced up for it to work, which makes it very difficult
to support scatterlists.  So considering just crypto_shash and crypto_ahash, it
really belongs in crypto_shash (whereas Herbert wants it to go in crypto_ahash).

You're correct that it could go in a SHA-256 library function instead of either
crypto_shash or crypto_ahash.  I think it would be slightly more convenient to
have it in crypto_shash, since the users that want this (dm-verity and
fs-verity) do support multiple hash algorithms and appreciate having the
*simple* abstraction layer of crypto_shash.

But I'd be okay with having a separate code path for SHA-256 too, and maybe this
is the best way out of this...  No need to use the "Crypto API" at all if it's
not going to provide what is needed.
