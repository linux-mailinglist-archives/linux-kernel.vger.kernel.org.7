Ok, now things start to make sense. Thanks for the explanation.

At least to me, using the same variable to store different time values
is a bit confusing.

Is it possible that we always store the timestamp of the last clock reset?

The invariant bound value (N) is fixed for each state, so we can have
the bound value in ha_verify_invariants() instead. For example, the
Python script can generate something like

static inline bool ha_verify_invariants(struct ha_monitor *ha_mon,
                                       enum states curr_state, enum events event,
                                       enum states next_state, u64 time_ns)
{
       if (curr_state == enqueued_stall)
               return ha_check_invariant_jiffy(ha_mon, threshold_jiffies, time_ns);
       return true;
}

Is that possible?

I think if we always store the timestamp since last reset, we can get
rid of this function. Let's see how that discussion go..

Make sense, thanks!
