Yup!

Yes, we had to add support for this type of problem.

Removing the driver entirely from the kernel "fixed" the vulnerability :)

We do not do email notifications when CVEs are altered.  You have to
watch the cve.org json feed for that.  Otherwise the email list would
just be too confusing.  Think about every new stable update that happens
which causes 10+ different CVEs to be updated showing where they are now
resolved.  That does not come across well in an email feed, but the json
feed shows it exactly.

Or you can follow the github cve feed, which shows this, OR you can just
follow the vulns.git git commits which also show this.

The process has changed in that we have had to handle a number of CVEs
where both the commit that caused the vulnerabilty has been tracked to
mutiple commits (think of one-off changes that only happened on
different stable branches, and then were fixed with different commit
ids, like what happened in CVE-2025-40364), or this example you are
pointing out where a vulnerability was introduced, later removed by
having the entire driver removed, and then added back by adding the
driver back and then resolving the vulnerability.

The original CVE had this information as you point out:

Showing that the kernel ranges from 4.18 -> 5.8 were NOT vulnerable to
this specific issue.  Information that is hopefully very valuable to
distros dealing with old kernels, like yours :)

So now we can properly handle this types of issues in an automated
fashion, thanks again for noticing, this was a non-trivial amount of
work to implement.  Given that no one had ever done this before, we have
had to create all of this "from scratch".

Our trees are crazy, hopefully this helps explain the lifecycle of
vulnerabilities and their fixes better than before.

One other note, perhaps you just want to parse the .dyad files we
create instead of mbox files?  That provides a machine-readable format
of what commits caused a specific vulnerability, and what commits fixed
it, if any, in any specific kernel branch that is known.  I know at
least one distro and one company that just relies on those files
directly instead of attempting to parse the crazy json output that
cve.org requires which in some places, I would argue, shows actually
incorrect information, but that's a different topic...

I really should write up more information about all of this one day, but
we've just been heads-down trying to implement all of this to deal with
the complexity involved in a way that is scalable over time.

Does that help?

thanks,

greg k-h
