For now, it is, yes. When this first series gets merged, I would come up 
with another series that will introduce other files for riscv to support 
thp contpte based on the arm64 implementation.

I can pick it up in the riscv tree once I have Acked-by from arm64 
maintainers.

Ryan is definitely a M, I would be happy to help as M too but if needed, 
a R is enough for me.

Yes, that's the name arm64 gave to this feature (more understandable 
than svnapot for the riscv feature).

You can do that or I can do it on my own based on your previous patches, 
as you prefer.

Thanks for jumping in!
