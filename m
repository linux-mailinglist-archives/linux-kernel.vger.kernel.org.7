Yes.  bprm->secureexec controls AT_SECURE.

I am fine if we want to set secureexec and AT_SECURE in this situation.
It is a bit odd, but I don't see a problem with that.

The patch that made the change doesn't show up on lore.kernel.org so I
believe any record of the rational is lost.

To me it looks like someone was right up against the deadline to get
their code change into 2.4.0, was used to uid !=3D euid in userspace, and
talked Linus into a last minute merge before 2.4.0 was released.
