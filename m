Patches based on tip tree x86/urgent branch plus Babu's v18 ABMC series.

Top commit of x86/urgent at time of my snapshot was:
d2e1b84c5141 ("fs/resctrl: Eliminate false positive lockdep warning when reading SNC counters")

Babu's ABMC series here:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1757108044.git.babu.moger@amd.com/

The combination of above components plus this series is here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aegl/linux.git rdt-aet-v10

Top commit:
89f7ddfa06e1 ("x86,fs/resctrl: Update Documentation for package events")

This series is the most recent 28 patches in that branch.

Changes since v9 was posted here:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250829193346.31565-1-tony.luck@intel.com/

(v9 patch numbers in "--- # ---" format. V10 references in "00##" format.)

First four patches are included in Babu's ABMC seriess so dropped
from here.

--- 5 ---
Now 0001
Added Reinette RB tag

--- 6 ---
Now 0002
Drop domain_header_is_valid() from domain_add_cpu_mon()
cpu_on_correct_domain() mostly pulled from patch 13 back to here as part
of refactor on top of Babu ABMC code

--- 7 ---
Now 0003
Drop changes to resctrl_offline_mon_domain() from this patch
and apply later in series when adding support for PERF_PKG
resource.

--- 8 ---
Now 0004
Added Reinette RB tag

--- 9 ---
Old patch 9 split into two parts:

New 0005 patch handles domain addition/deletion and puts temporary
"d = container_of(hdr, struct rdt_mon_domain, hdr);: into mon_event_read()
TODO: Add a post "---" commit comment explaining the mon_event_read() bit.

New 0006 patch covers to call chain from mon_event_read() through
to resctrl_arch_{cntr,rmid}_read() 

Drop check for "if (r->rid != RDT_RESOURCE_L3)" from resctrl_arch_rmid_read()
this "can never happen" case is handled by following domain_header_is_valid()

Drop call to domain_header_is_valid() in single domain branch of
rdtgroup_mondata_show() that has no following contain_of() that needs
to be checked.

Drop SNC related checks for RDT_RESOURCE_L3 from this patch. Defer until
addition of PERF_PKG resource.

"smaller of the "num_rmids" values" ->
"smaller of the L3_MON and PERF_PKG_MON "num_rmids" values"

"        This contains a set of directories, one for each instance
        of an L3 cache, another for each processor package." ->
"        This contains directories for each monitor domain. One set for each instance
        of an L3 cache, another set for each processor package."
Added note that the info/*/mon_features files enumerate all events.
prescence -> presence
will vary -> may vary
Drop "when and how often the hardware has failed" since only two
of the files deal with problems.

Background
----------
On Intel systems that support per-RMID telemetry monitoring each logical
processor keeps a local count for various events. When the
IA32_PQR_ASSOC.RMID value for the logical processor changes (or when a
two millisecond counter expires) these event counts are transmitted to
an event aggregator on the same package as the processor together with
the current RMID value. The event counters are reset to zero to begin
counting again.

Each aggregator takes the incoming event counts and adds them to
cumulative counts for each event for each RMID. Note that there can be
multiple aggregators on each package with no architectural association
between logical processors and an aggregator.

All of these aggregated counters can be read by an operating system from
the MMIO space of the Out Of Band Management Service Module (OOBMSM)
device(s) on a system. Any counter can be read from any logical processor.

Intel publishes details for each processor generation showing which
events are counted by each logical processor and the offsets for each
accumulated counter value within the MMIO space in XML files here:
https://github.com/intel/Intel-PMT.

For example there are two energy related telemetry events for the
Clearwater Forest family of processors and the MMIO space looks like this:

Offset  RMID    Event
------  ----    -----
0x0000  0       core_energy
0x0008  0       activity
0x0010  1       core_energy
0x0018  1       activity
...
0x23F0  575     core_energy
0x23F8  575     activity

In addition the XML file provides the units (Joules for core_energy,
Farads for activity) and the type of data (fixed-point binary with
bit 63 used to indicate the data is valid, and the low 18 bits as a
binary fraction).

Finally, each XML file provides a 32-bit unique id (or guid) that is
used as an index to find the correct XML description file for each
telemetry implementation.

The INTEL_PMT_TELEMETRY driver provides intel_pmt_get_regions_by_feature()
to enumerate the aggregator instances (also referred to as "telemetry
regions" in this series) on a platform. It provides:

1) guid  - so resctrl can determine which events are supported
2) MMIO base address of counters
3) package id

Resctrl accumulates counts from all aggregators on a package in order
to provide a consistent user interface across processor generations.

Directory structure for the telemetry events looks like this:

$ tree /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
mon_data
├── mon_PERF_PKG_00
│   ├── activity
│   └── core_energy
└── mon_PERF_PKG_01
    ├── activity
    └── core_energy

Reading the "core_energy" file from some resctrl mon_data directory shows
the cumulative energy (in Joules) used by all tasks that ran with the RMID
associated with that directory on a given package. Note that "core_energy"
reports only energy consumed by CPU cores (data processing units,
L1/L2 caches, etc.). It does not include energy used in the "uncore"
(L3 cache, on package devices, etc.), or used by memory or I/O devices.
