It would be nice if we can get some numbers to make sure there are no
regressions in common workloads, especially those that trigger a lot of
calls to folio_memcg() and friends.

Apart from isolated folios, we may come across folios that are locked or
have their refs frozen by someone else. I assume we wouldn't want to
mess with those folios. Such indetermenistic behavior was the main
reason my recharging approach was turned down:
