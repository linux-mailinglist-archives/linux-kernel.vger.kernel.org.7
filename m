The MPIDR changing isn't ok either. You might get away with that today,
but that's not supposed to change behind the back of the kernel.

Is there anything else that can change, or are we absolutley certain
that *only* MPIDR changes?

Ok, so that's a clear violation of the architecture, and doesn't fill me
with confidence about anything else.

Different certainly, but still problematic.

I maintain that we should not pretend to support this hardware.

Mark.
