Yes, both collapse and shrinker split hinge on max_ptes_none to prevent one of these things thrashing the effect of the other.

There are some very large workloads in the meta fleet that I experimented with and found that having
a small value works out. I experimented with 0, 51 (10%) and 256 (50%). 51 was found to be an optimal
comprimise in terms of application metrics improving, having an acceptable amount of memory regression and
improved system level metrics (lower TLB misses, lower page faults). I am sure there was a better value out
there for these workloads, but not possible to experiment with every value.

In terms of wider rollout across the fleet, we are going to target 0 (or a very very small value)
when moving from THP=madvise to always. Mainly because it is the least likely to cause a memory regression as
THP shrinker will deal with page faults faulting in mostly zero-filled pages and khugepaged wont collapse
pages that are dominated by 4K zero-filled chunks.
