Yes, I should use wait_event_timeout, I will fix it.

"lane/port" in the code does not refer to SERDES physical lanes (like KR4â€™s
4 lanes per port). It is for physical network ports (or a PF). We use
it as a valid bit since fw cmd support multiple physical network ports
within a pci device (with one mbx handler). So, for each PCI bus X, 'port'
is started from 0. 

PCI bus X -- port0
	  |
	  -- port1

PCI bus Y -- port0
	  |
	  -- port1

FW stores extended ability information in `ext_ability` as a 32-bit
little-endian value. To make these flags easily accessible in the kernel
(via named 'bitfields' instead of raw bitmask operations), we use the union's
`e_host` struct, which provides named bits (e.g., `wol_en`, `smbus_en`).
Others 'not bitfields' is just use 'lexx_to_cpu' when value is used.

Thanks for your feedback.
