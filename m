If we would want to keep an entry alive as long as there are more leaves, we'd
obviously need to reference count things.

But what do we need reference counting for with this logic? Shouldn't this be
also possible without?

I'm not sure about this one.

IIUC, this basically brings back the "keep() logic", which I still think is a
footgun and should be avoided.

Also, we only needed this, since due to the borrowing design we couldn't store
parent and child nodes in the same structure. With reference counting (or the
logic above) this goes away.

I wrote the following in a previous conversation [1].

--

What I see more likely to happen is a situation where the "root" directory
(almost) lives forever, and hence subsequent calls, such as

	root.subdir("foo").keep()

effectively are leaks.

One specific example for that would be usb_debug_root, which is created in the
module scope of usb-common and is used by USB host / gadget / phy drivers.

The same is true for other cases where the debugfs "root" is created in the
module scope, but subsequent entries are created by driver instances. If a
driver would use keep() in such a case, we'd effectively leak memory everytime a
device is unplugged (or unbound in general).
