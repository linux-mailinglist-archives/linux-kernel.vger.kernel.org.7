Great—looking forward to it at the LPC MC.

Yes, I also think "/sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers" is a better fit.

This part relates to my earlier point on runtime modification. My
intention was to only allow setting the tiers globally, and to align
bitmask with priority ranges. For example, an input like:

  ssd:100, hdd:50, network_swap

would translate into ranges as 100+ (bit0), 50–99 (bit1), and 0–49
(bit2).

From your description, I understand you are considering allowing
additive updates, insertions and letting bitmask differ from the range priority. Is
that correct? In that case we probably need a way to distinguish
between “add” and “reset”. Personally, I feel supporting only reset
semantics would make the interface simpler, while still allowing add
semantics when the full set is provided again.

Do you mean that if the cluster does not belong to the desired tier in
the fast path, it will skip and then fall back to the slow path? If so,
the slow path would need to avoid inserting the cluster back into the
cache, otherwise processes with a global swap view may end up using the
wrong tier device(which must be referenced firstly assumed)
Also cgroup which is tier set experience performance degradation 
because, there is possibility to try to alloc swap on slowpath most of the time.
Wouldn’t this have performance implications?  

I was thinking that maintaining per-tier per-cpu cluster caches would be
simpler. Then each tier manages its own cluster cache, and we only need
an array of per-cpu caches of size “max tiers”.

The similarity with cpuset is only in the text format. Like cpuset.cpus
uses a comma-separated list and dash ranges (e.g. "0-4,6,8-10"), the
swap tier interface would use the same style but with tier names. For
example:
  echo ssd-network_device,some_device2 > swap.tiers
This makes it easy for users to read and modify at runtime, and keeps
the interface consistent with existing cgroup controls.
(Reference: https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html, Cpuset Interface Files)

My current thought is that it might be simpler to avoid inheritance
entirely. Since this is a QoS interface rather than a resource limit
mechanism, inheritance semantics may not be the best fit. I would prefer
to always override based on what is explicitly set, and otherwise fall
back to global swap. For example, input like:

  swap.tiers = ssd,network_device,some_device2

would always override the setting directly, without any parent lookup.

My earlier comment was about allowing runtime modifications
to the global /sys/kernel/mm/swap/tiers.

Per your suggestion, the question of whether NUMA autobind 
is needed can be addressed in a dedicated discussion later. 
I look forward to it. :)

The NUMA autobind removal work.. possible directions could be:
  
  - runtime toggle (default off),  
  - keep default on but gradually flip to default off,  
    eventually remove entirely.
  - remove it. entirely.

Not a proposal —just a thought 

In my current patch,
tier and NUMA priorities are made mutually exclusive so they cannot be set together.

Agreed. It is better to defer until we see a concrete use case.

Right, if we want to support this usage, your point about LRU order must
definitely be addressed first.
