I chosen the code  that match with "*unlock*:" label.

Yes, as Dan mentioned[1], there are too many these patterns and I'm not 
sure how
much value we can get to do this things. This patch is a try that using 
guard() to
remove some  lock/unlock pattern and simplify the lock code.

Got it, it's ok to omit this patch. It seems this patch has not enough 
value.

Maybe only for some complex lock/unlock code, guard() can bring some value.
Thanks for your advice!
