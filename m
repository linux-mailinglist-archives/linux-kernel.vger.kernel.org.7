As Ted mentioned, Ext4 has never guaranteed deterministic allocation. We
do attempt a predetermined goal in ext4_mb_find_by_goal(), and this part
has no trylock logic, meaning we'll always attempt to scan the target
group once—that's deterministic.

However, if the target attempt fails, the primary goal for subsequent
allocation is to find suitable free space as quickly as possible, so
there's no need to contend with other processes for non-target groups.
