All we care here is actually the external verifier scenario because most
of this type of crypto where software must attest breaks without that,
including all confidential computing technologies.

It's true that in the current form the whole feature is at most defense
in depth. It could be e.g. extended with persistent keys and productized
more in the future (e.g., trusted keys were mostly useless for multiple
years).

I'd personally would like to keep it on at least on my own laptop and
there's a risk that there's a group of people who would either:

1. want to have that small amount defense in depth.
2. want to refine the feature.

It's by practical means already "relaxed" but outcomes are objectively
plain wrong (as you stated) so I'd take a bit more conservative approach
on changing the mainline and propose three state option:

1. off: fully turn off
2. relaxed: mark just a info or at most marning to klog that hmac
   encryption is not enable. Keep timeout short as ECC generation
   does not take long (if it is working) (at least according to
   my tests). It should also address the lack of TPM2_ContextSave.
   We really should probe that anyhow in the driver init and
   disable also /dev/tpmrm0 accordingly.
3. strict: enforce. This is good to have albeit now not really
   useful

The 'relaxed' is of course default.
