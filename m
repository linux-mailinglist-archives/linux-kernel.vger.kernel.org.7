Hi Mark,

The UFS QMP PHY driver is not the first client to use regulator_set_load 
or alternatively set load requirements and invoke enable/disable or 
alternatively

Similar to other PHY drivers (such as USB, Display, and Combo PHYs),
as well as various subsystem drivers like UFS, SDHCI, Bluetooth, and 
others, the QMP UFS PHY driver is communicating/setting its load 
requirements.

These drivers also define corresponding binding properties, as seen in 
the UFS instances documented here:

UFS Common DT Binding ((link - 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ufs/ufs-common.yaml?h=next-20250807) 


Relevant properties include:

vcc-max-microamp: Specifies the maximum load that can be drawn from the 
VCC supply
vccq-max-microamp: Specifies the maximum load that can be drawn from the 
VCCQ supply
vccq2-max-microamp: Specifies the maximum load that can be drawn from 
the VCCQ2 supply

There was a previous effort to introduce similar properties 
(vdda-phy-max-microamp and vdda-pll-max-microamp) in the device tree 
bindings.
Link - (link- 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-msm/patch/20220418205509.1102109-3-bhupesh.sharma@linaro.org/#24820481)

However, at that time, the driver-side implementation for aggregating 
load requests was not in place, which led to the patch not being merged:
Patch Reference

Currently, the regulator framework does support automatic aggregation of 
load requests from multiple client drivers. Therefore, it is reasonable 
and necessary for each client to individually communicate its expected 
runtime load to the regulator framework to put the regulators in current
operation mode.

Nitin
