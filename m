I will review and update accordingly.

Yes sure (and try to consolidate them as Thomas correctly pointed out).

Are you referring to KMALLOC_MAX_CACHE_SIZE or KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE ?

KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is set according to MAX_PAGE_ORDER, that should
be fine for most set-ups (well, obviously implementations that
only support a 1-level IST can't expect a very large number of
IRQs -  we set that to 12 bits worth of IDs deliberately but
given the current memory allocation limits it can be much higher).

A 2-level IST can easily manage 24-bits worth of IDs split into
two-level tables with the current kmalloc() limits.

For the ITS DT and ITT the same reasoning goes, so the capping
is the (rare) exception not the rule and I don't expect this to be a
problem at all or I am missing something.

You don't understand why the GIC HW is not coherent or why we set it
up as such in the driver ?

The IST is also written by the GIC, the CPU reads it (explicity, with a
memory read rather than through instructions) only if the table is two
level and we are allocating L2 entries on demand to check whether an
L2 entry is valid.

I am not sure the CMOs are that bad given that's what we do
for GICv3 already but it is worth looking into it.
