My point is your reasoning is true for all other callers of
add_bootloader_randomness(), so shouldn't all of them be handled the
same way? What guarantee do we have that UEFI implementation doesn't
give us all zeros too? We know it can happen since we're also
implementing the bootloader in this case, but that's not much better
than not knowing. And there is the 'trust_bootloader' flag too. Do we
want to warn about the bootloader seed if trust_bootloader=3D=3Dfalse?
There's also the minor issue that in 1-in-a-gazillion times, the
random value is all 0s. Does that matter? IDK. Really, you should ask
the folks that implemented this feature in the first place.

Well, I checked DTBs in the tree and the biggest is 178K, so we are a
lot further off from this being a problem than I thought. So I guess a
warning would be fine.
