Sure, but the driver is like I say doing nothing to actively manage the
current reporting.  It's just pulling a random number not specific to
the device (the max-microamp configuration is part of the constraints
which apply to the regualtor as a whole) out of the DT and throwing it
at the framework.

In that case this will definitely encounter the bug I mentioned above
where it's trying to read the maximum load permitted for the regulator
as a whole and report it as the load from this one specific device.

Wait, is this supposed to be some new property that you want to
standardise?  I didn't see a proposal for that, it's not something that
currently exists - the only standard properties that currently exist are
for the regulator as a whole. =20

I'm not super convinced this is a particularly common issue, most
devices perform pretty much the same regardless of the board design so
the driver should just know their peak consumption and it's becoming
less and less common for regulators to need software help to adapt to
loads.  The main use case these days seems to be for safety (eg,
constraining how much can be drawn via a USB port) which seems like it'd
either be for the full supply or just known by the driver.
