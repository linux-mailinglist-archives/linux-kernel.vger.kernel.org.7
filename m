No, the first event to be created is the "commit" event. If it gets
interrupted and the interrupt adds a bunch of events that wraps the
ring buffer, it can't touch the commit event, it will just start
dropping events. Then when the commit event finishes, it can either be
read by the reader, or overwritten by the next events coming in.

The reader is never in the write buffer. Just the head page will move.
When a new reader page is taken it will swap out the old reader page
with the head page. If the head page is the commit page, then the
commit page becomes the reader page too.

No, "writer overtook the reader" doesn't make sense as the reader is
not on the write buffer, so the writer can not catch up to it. What the
write buffer has is the "head" page which is where the next reader will
come to.

The only way reader_page == commit_page and reader_page != tail_page is
if the commit was interrupted and the interrupt added events and moved
forward off the commit_page. The only way there would be missed events
in that case is if the interrupt added so many events it wrapped the
buffer and then started dropping events.

Correct. But the writer could end up on the reader page after the swap,
if the head page happened to be the commit page.

Yes. When doing this stress test, it printed at most 4 times. It
happens once per time the interrupt fills the buffer while interrupting
the buffer.

I seldom ever get commit overruns. It's one of the fields in the status
file located in: /sys/kernel/tracing/per_cpu/cpu*/stats

Hmm, OK, I'll look at that.
