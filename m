firmware names should not be a problem. If downstream users decide to 
boot with lockstep as default, in effect there will be only one 
processor, and the primary firmware will be loaded into the CPU.

Other than ti,cluster-mode, no mods...

It is a fix, but not so critical that it should be backported to stable 
Kernels. That's because:

a. The primary core's firmware-name/path does not matter in DT here, as 
it is packed in the bootloader images and that core can not be loaded 
from anywhere else (DM core).
b. The support to boot this cluster in Split mode has just been posted 
now. So users might not be able to load/boot the secondary core before 
this support.

So I think fixing it in mainline is good enough as the support is also 
added now. Do you think we should add Fixes tag here?

The Kernel remoteproc driver handles that correctly by checking the CPU 
registers to see if it is in split mode[3]. If the bootloader was not 
able to boot this cluster in split mode, but the Kernel/bootloader DT 
says "ti,cluster-mode = 0", the driver forces it to boot in lockstep mode.

This is not really a new processor, its just a split CPU. As such we 
already have the carveouts for this split CPU upstreamed[4].

Do you want to see new overlays (containing mailbox configuration, timer 
configuration, mem carveouts) for each of the board? Because each board 
has a separate set of configuration for IPC.

This was a minor fix, and it essentially was only needed when we added 
split support for all SoCs, so I clubbed them together...
