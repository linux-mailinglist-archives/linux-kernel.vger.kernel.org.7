Right, so just adding in folio_mapcount() will be a no-op for migration,
but enable its reuse by can_split_folio().  Maybe.  Anyway, the way I
explain page refocunts to people (and I need to put this in a document
somewhere):

There are three types of contribution to the refcount:

 - Expected.  These are deducible from the folio itself, and they're all
   findable.  You need to figure out what the expected number of
   references are to a folio if you're going to try to freeze it.
   These can be references from the mapcount, the page cache, the swap
   cache, the private data, your call chain.
 - Temporary.  Someone else has found the folio somehow; perhaps through
   the page cache, or by calling GUP or something.  They mean you can't
   freeze the folio because you don't know who has the reference or how
   long they might hold it for.
 - Spurious.  This is like a temporary reference, but worse because if
   you read the code, there should be no way for there to be any temporary
   references to the folio.  Someone's found a stale pointer to this
   folio and has bumped the reference count while they check that the
   folio they have is the one they expected to find.  They're going
   to find out that the pointer they followed is stale and put their
   refcount soon, but in the meantime you still can't freeze the folio.

So I don't love the idea of having a function with the word "expected"
in the name that returns a value which doesn't take into account all
the potential contributors to the expected value.  And sure we can keep
adding qualifiers to the function name to indicate how it is to be used,
but at some point I think we should say "It's OK for this to be a little
less efficient so we can understand what it means".
