Hi all,

I've been looking at the evolution of the Qualcomm SMMU driver
(arm-smmu-qcom.c) and had a question about the design change for
configuring the SMMU_CB_ACTLR register.

It appears there are two different approaches:

1. The "SID" Approach (Older): In some versions, a driver would use a
large, platform-specific struct (e.g., sa8775p_apps_actlr_cfg) that
maps individual Stream IDs (SIDs) to specific ACTLR values. This
allowed for very granular, per-SID tuning. For example, a device with
10 SIDs could have a specific setting for just one (0x2141), while the
others used a default.

2. The "Compatible String" Approach (Newer/Upstream): The current
upstream driver appears to use a client_match array (an of_device_id
list) in qcom_smmu_init_context. This maps a device's compatible
string to a single ACTLR value, which is then written to the device's
assigned Context Bank.

I want to make sure I understand the implications of this new, simpler
approach, as it seems to introduce a trade-off where granularity is
lost:

Multiple SIDs, One Device: A single device that uses many SIDs in the
device tree (e.g., the video codec, which might list 0x2141, 0x25C1,
0x2161, etc.) will now have one ACTLR setting applied to the Context
Bank that serves all of those SIDs, even if the old SID-based list
only specified a setting for one of them.

Am I correct in this analysis? I'm assuming this was an intentional
design choice to simplify the driver, based on the assumption that all
SIDs for a single device (and all devices with the same compatible)
can share the same ACTLR tuning.

I'm working on porting settings for an sa8775p board and just want to
ensure I'm migrating the logic correctly to this new client_match
method.

Thanks for any clarification you can provide.

Best regards,

   Enric

>    be picked up as independent patch.
>  - Fix the codestyle to orient variables in reverse xmas tree format
>    for patch 1/5.
>  - Fix variable name in patch 1/5 as suggested.

> Changes in v4 from v3:
>  New addition:
>  - Remove actlrcfg_size and use NULL end element instead to traverse
>    the actlr table, as this would be a cleaner approach by removing
>    redundancy of actlrcfg_size.
>  - Renaming of actlr set function to arm_smmu_qcom based proprietary
>    convention.
>  - break from loop once sid is found and ACTLR value is initialized
>    in qcom_smmu_set_actlr.
>  - Modify the GFX prefetch value separating into 2 sensible defines.
>  - Modify comments for prefetch defines as per SMMU-500 TRM.
>  Changes to incorporate suggestions from Konrad as follows:
>  - Use Reverse-Christmas-tree sorting wherever applicable.
>  - Pass arguments directly to arm_smmu_set_actlr instead of creating
>    duplicate variables.
>  - Use array indexing instead of direct pointer addressed by new
>    addition of eliminating actlrcfg_size.
>  - Switch the HEX value's case from upper to lower case in SC7280
>    actlrcfg table.
>  Changes to incorporate suggestions from Dmitry as follows:
>  - Separate changes not related to ACTLR support to different commit
>    with patch 5/5.
>  - Using pointer to struct for arguments in smr_is_subset().
>  Changes to incorporate suggestions from Bjorn as follows:
>  - fix the commit message for patch 2/5 to properly document the
>    value space to avoid confusion.
>  Fixed build issues reported by kernel test robot [1] for
>  arm64-allyesconfig [2].

> Changes in v3 from v2:
>  New addition:
>  - Include patch 3/4 for adding ACTLR support and data for SC7280.
>  - Add driver changes for actlr support in gpu smmu.
>  - Add target wise actlr data and implementation ops for gpu smmu.
>  Changes to incorporate suggestions from Robin as follows:
>  - Match the ACTLR values with individual corresponding SID instead
>    of assuming that any SMR will be programmed to match a superset of
>    the data.
>  - Instead of replicating each elements from qcom_smmu_match_data to
>    qcom_smmu structre during smmu device creation, replace the
>    replicated members with qcom_smmu_match_data structure inside
>    qcom_smmu structre and handle the dereference in places that
>    requires them.
>  Changes to incorporate suggestions from Dmitry and Konrad as follows:
>  - Maintain actlr table inside a single structure instead of
>    nested structure.
>  - Rename prefetch defines to more appropriately describe their
>    behavior.
>  - Remove SM8550 specific implementation ops and roll back to default
>    qcom_smmu_500_impl implementation ops.
>  - Add back the removed comments which are NAK.
>  - Fix commit description for patch 4/4.

> Changes in v1 from RFC:
>  - Incorporated suggestion form Robin on RFC
>  - Moved the actlr data table into driver, instead of maintaining

>    smmu probe.
