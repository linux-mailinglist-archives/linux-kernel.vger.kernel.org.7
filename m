Yep, it has per-task + per-CPU events.

Thing is that the kernel doesn't know the relationship between events.
For example, if I run this command on a machine with 100 CPUs:

  $ perf record -e cycles,instructions -- $MYPROG

it would open 200 events and they don't know each other.  Later other
process can start a new perf profiling for the same task.  IIUC there's
no way to identify which one is related in the kernel.

So I think we need a way to share some informaiton for those 200 events
and then emits deferred callchain records with the shared info.

Yep, but the kernel should know which events (or ring buffer) it should
emit the deferred callchains.  I don't think it needs to include the
cookie in the perf data, but it can be used to find which event or ring
buffer for the session is related to this request.
