That would be very convenient, but given that we have 20+ different
types of debugfs files that we can create, that might get complex to
define that way.  But that's just an implementation detail to work
out...

I agree, I can live with that too.

"ghost" objects will get messy I think, and yes, cleaning up will be a
bit tricky here, which is why at the C level I am taking away the idea
of a file that can be controlled as an individual object entirely.  If
you want the Rust code to have objects for the files, that's something
that the bindings are going to have to handle well.  Somehow :)
