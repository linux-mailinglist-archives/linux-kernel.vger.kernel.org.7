I understand the concern, however IMHO that's really why mm can be hard and
important at the same time..

We definitely have driver code manipulating pgtables.  We also have folios
or pages that can be directly accessible from drivers.

After all mm is the core function provider for those and there needs to be
some API accessing them from outside.

I agree some protection would be nice, like what Suren did with the
vm_flags using __private, even though it's unfortunate it only works with
sparse not a warn/error when compiling, as vm_flags is not a pointer.
OTOH, forbid exposing anything might be an overkill, IMHO.  It stops mm
from growing in healthy ways.

For this specific case, I'm happy to be copied if guest-memfd will start to
support userfaultfd, because obviously I also work with the kvm community.
It'll be the same if not, as I'm list as an userfaultfd reviewer.

But when it's in the modules, it should really be the modules job.  It's ok
too when it's an API then mm people do not get copied.  It looks fine to me.

True, it's just unavoidable IMHO, and after triaged then the module owner
needs to figure out how to fix it, not a mm developer, if the bug only
happens with the module.

It's the same when a module allocated a folio/page and randomly update its
flags.  It may also crash core mm later.  We can have more protections all
over the places but I don't see an easy way to completely separate core mm
from modules.

That's totally ok.  I appreciate Nikita's help completely and never thought
it as an issue.  IMHO the leak is not a big deal in verifying the API.

I replied to Mike already before we extended this thread.  Feel free to
chime in with any suggestions on top.  So far this series is still almost
the best I can think of.
