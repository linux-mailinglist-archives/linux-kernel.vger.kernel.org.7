Yeah, AC is way too volatile=2E=20

This thread veered off topic, though=2E The point wasn't that EFI runtime =
calls weren't crap, but that LASS, SMEP, and SMAP add no value during the E=
FI runtime call *because we explicitly unmap user space anyway* (efi_mm) so=
 there are no user space mappings to worry about, so disabling them during =
the execution of the EFI runtime call makes no difference at all =E2=80=94 =
*as long as* the CR4 manipulation is done strictly inside the efi_mm switch=
=2E
