Sorry about my fumbling explanations repeatedly but this isn't true. On
cgroup2, if you create a cgroup, enable controllers and then seed it with
CLONE_INTO_CGROUP, threadgroup_rwsem is out of the picture. The only
remaining contention point is cgroup_mutex.

A percpu rwsem (threadgroup_rwsem) was used instead of per-threadgroup
locking to avoid adding overhead to hot paths - fork and exit - because
cgroup operations were expected to be a lot colder. Now, threadgroup rwsem
is *really* expensive for the writers, so the trade-off could be a bit too
extreme for some use cases.

However, now that the most common usage pattern doesn't involve
threadgroup_rwsem, I don't feel too enthusiastic about adding hot path
overhead to work around usage patterns that we want to move away from. Note
that dynamic migrations have other more fundamental problems for stateful
resources and we generally want to move away from it. Sure, a single rwsem
operation in fork/exit isn't a lot of overhead but it isn't nothing either
and this will impact everybody.

Maybe we can make it a mount option so that use cases that still depend on
it can toggle it on? In fact, there's already favordynmods mount option
which seems like a good fit. Maybe put the extra locking behind that flag?

Thanks.
