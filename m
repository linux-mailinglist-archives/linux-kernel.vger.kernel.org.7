Good point. TBH, I did not give it enough consideration until your
remdinding, but let me elaborate on why I suggested the approach above.

My suggestion is coming for handling the case you mentioned.  Let us see
the combinations:

 PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 0
 PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0xFFFF,FFFF,FFFF,FFFF
   No filtering on data source

 PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 1
 PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0xFFFF,FFFF,FFFF,FFFF
   No filtering on data source

 PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 0
 PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0x0
   No filtering on data source

 PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 1
 PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0x0
   Filtering on all data source

If 'PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 0 and PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0xFFFF,FFFF,FFFF,FFFF' is
initialized state, when a user set all bits to '1' for the data source
filter, then no matter we enable or disable FDS bit, it can work as
expected for disabling filtering.

If 'PMSFCR_EL1.FDS == 0 and PMSDSFR_EL1 == 0x0' is the init state, as
you said, when user passed 0xFFFF,FFFF,FFFF,FFFF for data filter, we
cannot distinguish it from the init state, as a result, we will fail
to handle this case.

How about you think?

Thanks,
Leo
