If you stick the cas*t instruction in its own helper say, cmpxchg_user(),
then you can do all the shifting/masking in C and I don't reckon it's
that bad. It means we (a) get rid of exclusives, which is the whole
point of this and (b) don't have to mess around with PAN.

I was thinking that too. I'm sure I remember a 'futextest' kicking
around when we did the arm64 port but nowadays there's something in
tools/testing/selftests/futex/ which might be better.
