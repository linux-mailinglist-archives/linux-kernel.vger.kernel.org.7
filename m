IDK if it is intentional, but while you mention this here it doesn't
appear in the text below. Probably as simple as "DON'T use versioned
compatibles, unless documenting a HDL IP core"?

Isn't this wrong? If you're a subset of a prior implementation, falling
back to the prior implementation's compatible would enable features that
are not present in the new device. That's not something you introduced,
it's the existing wording, but I don't think that's correct. It would have
to be a /superset/ of a prior implementation for this to be correct, no?

I think it might be best to break each "DO" or "DON'T" into a bullet
point of its own. At least it'd make it more clear what the specific dos
and don'ts are.

I hate to nitpick language to a non-native speaker, but when you have a
plural "fallbacks", it would be "Specific SoC compatibles are also
preferred". Probably also "SoC-specific" too, to match the wording used
in the bullet prior?

"DON'T", not "DON't". But this immediately contradicts itself, so maybe
a different wording could be used here. Maybe "DON'T make changes that
break the ABI without explicit and detailed rationale for why the
changes have to be made and their impact."?

I think this should be "ABI impact /goes/ beyond /the/ Linux kernel,
because it /also/ covers other open-source upstream projects.".

Cheers,
Conor.
