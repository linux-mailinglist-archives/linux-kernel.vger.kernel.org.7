I am having a bit of difficulty understanding this so let's talk about cases
where the ICAP is enabled/disabled -

1. When writing the fabric from the driver
   In this situation it might make sense to read the state of the ICAP
   interface when preparing the fabric, before enabling PCAP. When the write
   completes you could re-enable the ICAP if it was previously enabled.

   This might be outside the scope of this change - and I am not comfortable
   enough with this use-case to understand potential side effects from doing
   this. Logically it makes sense, but there may be a very specific reason that
   the ICAP must be enabled after doing a fabric load or partial
   reconfiguration.

2. When the FPGA driver loads and is probed by the DTS
   In this situation, which is covered by this patch, the FPGA is loaded by
   BootROM/FSBL but contains functionality that requires the ICAP. Unless the
   user has made modifications to the FSBL or 3rd stage bootloader there is no
   clear way to enable the ICAP interface. Checking to see if it had been
   enabled prior to loading this driver does not (in my opinion) make a lot of
   sense here.

   Perhaps the name of the DTS is confusing? The suffix '-on-load' was meant to
   indicate when the driver was loaded, not the fabric. Would the suffix
   '-on-probe' be more clear?

Let me know your thoughts,
-Sam
