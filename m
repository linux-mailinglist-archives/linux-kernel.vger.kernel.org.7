That's kinda obvious, but with the new timer migration model, which
stops to place timers by crystalball logic, this might not longer be
true and needs actual data to back up that claim.

I agree with the latter, but is your 'few active cores' claim backed by
actual data taken from a current kernel or based on historical evidence
and hearsay?

The idea itself is not that horrible. Though we should tap into the
existing accounting resources to figure that out instead of adding yet
another ill defined global counter to the mess. All the required metrics
should be there already.

Actually it should be solvable if you look at it just from a per CPU
perspective. This assumes that NOHZ_IDLE is active, because if it is not
then you can just go and skew unconditionally.

If a CPU is busy, then it just arms the tick skewed. If it goes idle,
then it looks at the expected idle time, which is what NOHZ does already
today. If it decides to stop the tick until the next timer list expires,
then it aligns it. Earlier expiring high resolution timers obviously
override the initial decision, but that's not much different from what
is happening today already.

Same question as above.

Feel free to scale back to 4 cores and enjoy the undefined BKL
semantics forever in your own fork of 2.2.final :)
