I agree with Jon: it is time to retire the perl version.

The problem is that one may want to document both _foo() and foo(),
if they have different arguments. I'm pretty sure we have cases like
that.

If I"m not mistaken, if you do things like that, kernel-doc.py will
complain that "foo" is not "numa_foo". It will also complain that
"nid" doesn't exist and "node" is not documented.

Basically, there is a strict check there (if it got properly 
backported from the Perl version) which checks if kernel-doc
is documenting the next function prototype name and argument
names.

The rationale is that we caught several cases where a function was
removed, renamed and/or have their parameters renamed without the
corresponding kernel-doc change. So, the verification is now
stricter (*). When we enabled such check, we fixed several bad
kernel-doc markups.

(*) Also, kernel-doc handles files in one pass at read time,
    sequentially. It could be possible to change it, but kernel-doc 
    is already complex enough, and placing the markup just before
    the function is a good practice anyway.

Heh, for my taste, having kernel-docs at header files look better, as
this is where the kAPIs should be defined anyway. 

Ok, one may change the behavior of a function without touching the
arguments and forget to update kernel-doc at the header files to tell
about such change, but this is problematic anyway, as, if someone is
relying on a certain behavior of a kAPI function, changing its behavior
may result on unexpected results at the current callers - and even
future callers.

Thanks,
Mauro
