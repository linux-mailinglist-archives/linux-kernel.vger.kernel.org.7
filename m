Subject: [PATCH v2 1/5] x86/sme: Use percpu boolean to control wbinvd during kexec

On SME platforms, at hardware level dirty cachelines with and without
encryption bit of the same memory can coexist, and the CPU can flush
them back to memory in random order.  During kexec, the caches must be
flushed before jumping to the new kernel to avoid silent memory
corruption when a cacheline with a different encryption property is
written back over whatever encryption properties the new kernel is
using.

TDX also needs cache flush during kexec for the same reason.  It would
be good to implement a generic way to flush cache instead of scattering
checks for each feature all around.

During kexec, the kexec-ing CPU sends IPIs to all remote CPUs to stop
them before it boots to the new kernel.  For SME the kernel basically
encrypts all memory including the kernel itself by manipulating page
tables.  A simple memory write from the kernel could dirty cachelines.

Currently, the kernel uses WBINVD to flush cache for SME during kexec in
two places:

1) the one in stop_this_cpu() for all remote CPUs when the kexec-ing CPU
   stops them;
2) the one in the relocate_kernel() where the kexec-ing CPU jumps to the
   new kernel.

Unlike SME, TDX can only dirty cachelines when it is used (i.e., when
SEAMCALLs are performed).  Since there are no more SEAMCALLs after the
aforementioned WBINVDs, leverage this for TDX.

In order to have a generic way to cover both SME and TDX, use a percpu
boolean to indicate the cache may be in an incoherent state thus cache
flush is needed during kexec, and turn on the boolean for SME.  TDX can
then leverage it by also turning the boolean on.

A percpu boolean isn't strictly needed for SME since it is activated at
very early boot time and on all CPUs.  A global flag would be sufficient.

A percpu boolean isn't strictly needed for SME since it is activated at
very early boot time and on all CPUs.  A global flag would be
sufficient.  But using a percpu variable has two benefits.  Foremost,
the state that is being tracked here (percpu cache coherency situation
requiring a flush) is percpu, so a percpu state is a more direct and
natural fit.

Secondly, it will fit TDX's usage better since the percpu var can be set
when a CPU makes a SEAMCALL, and cleared when another WBINVD on the CPU
obviates the need for a kexec-time WBINVD.  Saving kexec-time WBINVD is
valuable, because there is an existing race[*] where kexec could proceed
while another CPU is active.  WBINVD could make this race worse, so it's
worth skipping it when possible.

Today the first WBINVD in the stop_this_cpu() is performed when SME is
*supported* by the platform, and the second WBINVD is done in
relocate_kernel() when SME is *activated* by the kernel.  Make things
simple by changing to do the second WBINVD when the platform supports
SME.  This allows the kernel to simply turn on this percpu boolean when
bringing up a CPU by checking whether the platform supports SME.

No other functional change intended.

Also, currently machine_check() has a comment to explain why no function
call is allowed after load_segments().  After changing to use the new
percpu boolean to control whether to perform WBINVD when calling the
relocate_kernel(), that comment isn't needed anymore.  But it is still a
useful comment, so expand the comment around load_segments() to mention
that due to depth tracking no function call can be made after
load_segments().

[*] The "race" in native_stop_other_cpus()

Commit

  1f5e7eb7868e: ("x86/smp: Make stop_other_cpus() more robust")

introduced a new 'cpus_stop_mask' to resolve an "intermittent lockups on
poweroff" issue which was caused by the WBINVD in stop_this_cpu().
Specifically, the new cpumask resolved the below problem mentioned in
that commit:

    CPU0                                    CPU1

     stop_other_cpus()
       send_IPIs(REBOOT);                   stop_this_cpu()
       while (num_online_cpus() > 1);         set_online(false);
       proceed... -> hang
                                              wbinvd()

While it fixed the reported issue, that commit explained the new cpumask
"cannot plug all holes either".

This is because it doesn't address the "race" mentioned in the #3 in the
comment in native_stop_other_cpus():

        /*
         * 1) Send an IPI on the reboot vector to all other CPUs.
         *
         *    The other CPUs should react on it after leaving critical
         *    sections and re-enabling interrupts. They might still hold
         *    locks, but there is nothing which can be done about that.
         *
         * 2) Wait for all other CPUs to report that they reached the
         *    HLT loop in stop_this_cpu()
         *
         * 3) If #2 timed out send an NMI to the CPUs which did not
         *    yet report
         *
         * 4) Wait for all other CPUs to report that they reached the
         *    HLT loop in stop_this_cpu()
         *
         * #3 can obviously race against a CPU reaching the HLT loop late.
         * That CPU will have reported already and the "have all CPUs
         * reached HLT" condition will be true despite the fact that the
         * other CPU is still handling the NMI. Again, there is no
         * protection against that as "disabled" APICs still respond to
         * NMIs.
         */

Consider below case:

    CPU 0					CPU 1

    native_stop_other_cpus()			stop_this_cpu()

	// sends REBOOT IPI to stop remote CPUs
						...
						wbinvd();

	// wait timesout, try NMI
	if (!cpumask_empty(&cpus_stop_mask)) {
		for_each_cpu(cpu, &cpus_stop_mask) {

						...
						cpumask_clear_cpu(cpu,
							&cpus_stop_mask);
						hlt;

			// send NMI 	--->
						wakeup from hlt and run
						stop_this_cpu():

			// WAIT CPUs TO STOP
			while (!cpumask_empty(
			    &cpus_stop_mask) &&
				...)
		}
						...
		proceed ...			wbinvd();
						...
						hlt;

The "WAIT CPUs TO STOP" is supposed to wait until all remote CPUs are
stopped, but actually it quits immediately because the remote CPUs have
been cleared in cpus_stop_mask when stop_this_cpu() is called from the
REBOOT IPI.

Doing WBINVD in stop_this_cpu() could potentially increase the chance to
trigger the above "race" despite it's still rare to happen.
