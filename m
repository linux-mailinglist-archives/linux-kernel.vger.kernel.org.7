OK, so I have dived into this deeper just to be sure 
	- fix ed61c5913950 merged v6.13-rc1
	- breaker: the commit says Fixes: a49d25364dfb merged v4.12-rc1 which
	  indeed adds  ia_css_3a_statistics_allocate and uses it in atomisp_alloc_3a_output_buf
	- now we have 51b8dc5163d2 ("media: staging: atomisp: Remove driver")
	  merged 4.18 mentioned in .sha1 file which drops the whole
	  driver. The driver was later reintroduced by ad85094b293e in v5.8-rc1
	- that being said the kernel has been vulnerable since 4.12
	  until 4.18 and 5.8 until 6.13. There is a gap when the code
	  was not there and the kernel was therefore not affected. 
All that being said I do understand the second entry now but considering
the first entry and its Fixes tag I believe the second entry is simply
redundant.

CVE-2024-53204, CVE-2024-53205 are the same situation.

CVE-2025-40364 is different. Both of the sha1 entries are stable
specific commits (same change) with a references to Fixes: c7fb19428d67d
merged in v5.19-rc1. This one has a follow up fix merged in fc9375e3f763
v5.19-rc3. 
So this CVE seems like stable specific (probably a misbackport?) or is this
a mistake?

AFAICS there usually are no updates to CVE-$FOO.sha1 file and that is what
really matters to us to identify all the commits that are associated
with the specific CVE.
