In interleaved mode, the QMC will not allow that. You can have 
TS0-TS1-TS2 or TS1-TS2-TS0 but you can't have TS0-TS2-TS1.

In non-interleaved mode we mimic the interleaved mode so I don't expect 
it either.

That would be right if the channels were starting all at exactely the 
same time. But qmc_audio_pcm_write_submit() and 
qmc_audio_pcm_read_submit() are calling resp. qmc_chan_write_submit() 
and qmc_chan_read_submit() one by one.

Even if that happens it shouldn't be a problem on its own as there are 
only a few microseconds between each Timeslot (a full cycle is 125 µs). 
And also because calling snd_pcm_period_elapsed() doesn't have any 
destructive effect on ongoing processing.

So I wouldn't make it too complicated. Here the benefit is real and 
worth it.

Thanks,
Christophe
