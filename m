I am sure shmem will not use thp_vma_suitable_order() for pagecache 
alignment checks, because shmem has explicit code for pagecache 
alignment checks.

Adding thp_vma_suitable_order() in shmem is more about following the 
allocation logic of anonymous pages. I also think the 'IS_ALIGNED()' 
check in thp_vma_suitable_order() for shmem is more about 'optimization' 
rather than 'correction'. Anyway, I will take another look at shmem's 
checking logic.
