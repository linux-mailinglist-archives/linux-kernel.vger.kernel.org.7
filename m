There is the mechanism (which you have described above), and then there
are the use cases.  Those of us maintaining a given mechanism might
argue that a detailed description of the mechanism suffices, but that
argument does not always win the day.

I do like the description in the stop_machine() kernel-doc header:

 * This can be thought of as a very heavy write lock, equivalent to
 * grabbing every spinlock in the kernel.

Though doesn't this need to upgrace "spinlock" to "raw spinlock"
now that PREEMPT_RT is in mainline?

Also, this function is more powerful than grabbing every write lock
in the kernel because it also excludes all regions of code that have
preemption disabled, which is one thing that CPU hotplug is relying on.
Any objection to calling out that additional semantic?

							Thanx, Paul
