I've figured out that the SubDir API (and indeed, all patchsets after
v1) have a flaw in them, so I'm wondering if your rework will resolve
this.

If I do:
```
let dir =3D Dir::new(c_str!("foo"));
let subdir =3D dir.subdir(c_str!("bar"));
drop(dir);
// This next line will Oops because subdir is already removed
drop(Dir::from(subdir));
```

Simply removing `Dir::from` from the API won't resolve this - as long
as `SubDir` has any method, accessing it after its parent has been
cleaned up with `remove` will result in an oops.

The options I can see given the existing API are:
A. SubDir needs to be inherently limited to a borrow of another Dir or
SubDir. This will still break if someone uses
`debugfs_lookup_and_remove()` in an antisocial fashion, but we haven't
bound this in Rust, and we don't need to be robust against bad
behavior from C. If we do this, the promotability of subdirectories
back to directories would go away entirely,
B. I can leverage `dget`/`dput` to make it so that the directory I get
back from the APIs are actually owning, and so the dentry will not be
released while the Dir/SubDir exists. I understand this to be
undesired, but putting it out there, since it'd make things safe even
to `debugfs_lookup_and_remove()`.
C. I can limit use of `debugfs_remove` to the builder API (exists in
V1, no longer exists in this version, will be a separate patch soon
for reference). This is the behavior that I had written in V1 before I
started trying to adapt to requests. This means that the subdirectory
handles will remain valid because the non-builder handles will be
`dput` rather than recursively removed. Builder handles can't be
smuggled out due to an existential lifetime. Again, I understand this
is not desired, I'm just trying to lay out all ways to prevent this
class of error.
