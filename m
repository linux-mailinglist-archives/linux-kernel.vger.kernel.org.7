But it turns out that you're proposing complex changes for something that
is essentially a non-issue. In the real world, applications don't spam
signals and I'm not sure we want to support that scenario.

But that's impossible. Even before migration to ucounts, some rlimits
(RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE, RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, RLIMIT_SIGPENDING, RLIMIT_NPROC) were
bound to user_struct. I mean, atomic counter and "bottleneck" was there.
We can't remove the counters for that rlimits and they will have an
impact.

These rlimits are now counted per-namespace. In real life, docker/podman
creates a separate user namespace for each container from init_user_ns.
Usually only one additional counter is added for each rlimit in this way.

All I'm saying is that "bottleneck" with atomic counter was there before
and can't be removed anywhere.
