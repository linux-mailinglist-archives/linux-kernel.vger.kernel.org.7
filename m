The whole paragraph is wrong as written, not least because it is 
conflating two separate things: "any physical address" is objectively 
untrue, since SWIOTLB can only bounce from buffers within by the 
kernel's linear/direct map, i.e. not highmem, not random memory 
carveouts, and and definitely not PAs which are not RAM at all. 
Secondly, even if the source buffer *is* bounceable/mappable, there is 
still no guarantee at all that it can actually be made to appear at a 
DMA address within an arbitrary DMA mask. We aim for a general 
expectation that 32-bit DMA masks should be well-supported (but still 
not 100% guaranteed), but anything smaller can absolutely still have a 
high chance of failing, e.g. due to the SWIOTLB buffer being allocated 
too high or limited IOVA space.

Yes, almost certainly, because "DMA-addressable" depends on individual 
devices. You can't stop a user from sticking, say, a Broadcom 43xx WiFi 
card into a PCI slot on an i.MX6 board with 2GB of RAM that *starts* 
just above its 31-bit DMA capability. People are still using AMD Seattle 
machines, where even though arm64 does have SWIOTLB it's essentially 
useless since RAM starts up around 40 bits IIRC (and although they do 
also have SMMUs for PCI, older firmware didn't advertise them).

It's not really that simple. SWIOTLB, ZONE_DMA, etc. require platform 
support, which end users can't just turn on if it's not there to begin with.

Thanks,
Robin.
