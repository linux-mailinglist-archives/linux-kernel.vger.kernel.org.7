Yes, intentionally so, as mentioned I didn't even rename any of the 
APIs beyond the trivial conversion, because I wanted to gather feedback 
first:

Can you please acknowledge this clearly declared, intentionally limited 
scope of the -v1 series, instead of deriding it as 'mindless'? :-)

I didn't want to mix namespace cleanups with functional cleanups, but 
sure, I'd be glad to do that too.

Please do!

See why I sent the simple approach first? :-)

No arguments from me! :-)
