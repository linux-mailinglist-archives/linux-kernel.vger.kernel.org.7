Agreed. All these patches have been really harmless clean ups and re-orgs etc,
that do not affect existing 64 bit page table management or its functioning in
any manner. OTOH these changes help the kernel prepare for D128 enablement.

Keeping KVM changes separate was the motivation in V1 of this patch for similar
reasons. KVM uses FIELD_GET() for all the page table management purposes, hence
wanted to keep these S1 changes separate.
