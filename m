You could also grab a mutex in those driver work items that is held while
waiting for a dma_fence somewhere. The dma_fence annotations should catch
that, but at least in my reading of the text here it's not covered.

But my main point is what I explain below, the text fails to clearly
address the issues that all current drivers (maybe all reasonable drivers,
but sometimes I lack imagination) can encounter, so to me it's too generic
and not that directly applicable in practice. And then on the other hand
dma_fence is definitely the big thing, but fundamtentally you tie anything
you schedule on those wq to the drm/scheduler design in it's entirety. So
for the general rule, it's not generic enough for my taste.

Both examples talk about ordered wq, they don't make any sense with
max_active > 1, and I can't come up with any example that would. So yeah
I'm leaning in that direction, at least in the docs. Only discussing
max_active > 1 for this specific issue is imo very confusing and not
helping much. I guess we could even WARN_ON if a provided wq is not
ordered, because that does smell funky for sure.
