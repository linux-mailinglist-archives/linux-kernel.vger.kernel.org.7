My intention here was to be conservative. It seems safe to send a
Bitmap to a different thread,
in the sense that it would not cause data races.

Maybe it would be better to commit now to keep Bitmap "send"able - for all =
time.
It would however constrain the API quite a bit. One could never use this AP=
I
with a thread-local bitmap.

At the moment, we do not permit construction of a Rust Bitmap from an
existing C bitmap.
The point is more about the other direction though, not being able to
pass the Rust-owned bitmap to C code.

One could think of an API that requires an exclusively owned (no one
else has access) pointer to a C bitmap to Rust.
Though there is no general way to ensure that property, there are
situations where it would make sense (e.g. newly created).

ok, I will mention it there. I have not run this against the Rust native bi=
tmap.
I'd need to find out how to get a Rust native bitmap into kernel Rust code.

I considered it, but could not convince myself that __set_bit etc are
actually always safe.
For the methods that have the hardening assert, I was sure, but for
this one, not.

Are all bit ops guaranteed to handle out-of-bounds gracefully?

If there is no risk of undefined behavior, then I agree that checking
bounds is hardening.
If a missing bounds check loses safety, we then we should not skip it.

The hardening was enabled and it crossed my mind to mention it.
Given that not all methods have hardening, I though it might be misleading.

I'll have a more complete comparision and description in the next version.
