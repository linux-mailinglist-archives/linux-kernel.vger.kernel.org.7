Replace verbatim license text with a `SPDX-License-Identifier`

The comment heades mis-attributes this license to be "X11", but the
license text does not include the last line "Except as contained in this
notice, the name of the X Consortium shall not be used in advertising or
otherwise to promote the sale, use or other dealings in this Software
without prior written authorization from the X Consortium.". Therefore,
this license is actually equivalent to the SPDX "MIT" license (confirmed
by text diffing).

On top, half of the files have the fragment "either version 2 of the
License" for some reason, and not follow up with "or any later version".
So the resulting SPDX license is still "GPL-2.0-only".
