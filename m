You're right to ask for clarification.
The extended compact unwind information works with shrink wrapping.

For context, a FDE in .eh_frame costs at least 20 bytes (often 30+),
plus its associated .eh_frame_hdr entry costs 8 bytes.
Even a larger compact unwind descriptor at 8 bytes yields significant
savings compared to .eh_frame. Tripling that to 24 bytes is still a
substantial win.

Additionally, very few functions benefit from shrink wrapping
optimization. When needed, we require multiple unwind description
records (typically 3).

Yes. I believe it means the epilogue mirrors the prologue. Since we
know which registers were saved in the prologue, we can infer the pop
instructions in the epilogue and compute the SP offset when unwinding
in the middle of an epilogue.

A profiler can trivially retrieve the return address using the default
rule: if a code region is not covered by metadata, assume the return
address is available at *rsp (x86-64) or in the link register (most
other architectures).

This ld-generated unwind info feature is largely obsolete nowadays due
to the prevailing use of -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now (BIND_NOW). PLT entries
behave as functions without a prologue, so a profiler can trivially
retrieve the return address using the default unwinding rule.

As mentioned, even a larger compact unwind descriptor at 8 bytes
yields significant savings compared to .eh_frame, and is also
substantially smaller than SFrame.

I think this is about support for callee-saved registers, a feature
SFrame doesn't have.

I need to think about the details, but this thread is probably not the
best place to discuss them.

I think this just hard-encodes the default rule, similar to what
SFrame does: "AMD64 ABI mandates that the RA be saved at a fixed
offset from the CFA when entering a new function."

While I haven't given this much thought yet, I don't think this
introduces problems that SFrame doesn't have.

Yes, the linker does perform deduplication and builds the paged index
structure. However, the fundamental compactness comes from the
encoding itself: each regular function is described with just 4 bytes
in the common encoding, compared to .sframe's much larger per-FDE
overhead.
The two-level lookup table optimization amplifies this advantage.

The linker input and output use different section names, so a dumb
linker would work as long as the runtime accepts the concatenated
sections.

My vision for an ELF compact unwind format uses separate section names
for link-time vs. runtime representations. The compiler output format
should be concatenable, with linker index-building as an optional
optimization that improves performance but isn't mandatory for
correctness.

I'll going to add more details

The format supports i386, x86-64, aarch32, and aarch64. The OpenVMS
proposal demonstrates that supporting asynchronous unwinding is
straightforward.

Making it linker-friendly does not impose negative effects on the
output section size.

Agreed. My concern is that .sframe is being deployed before we've
fully explored whether a more compact and efficient alternative is
achievable.

At this point, I'm not certain about specific modifications to .sframe
itself. I think we should start from scratch, drawing ideas from
compact unwind information and Windows ARM64.

The existing compact unwind information uses the following 4-byte descripto=
r:

  uint32_t mode_specific_encoding : 24; // vary with different modes

  uint32_t mode : 4; // UNWIND_X86_64_MODE_MASK =3D=3D UNWIND_ARM64_MODE_MA=
SK

  uint32_t has_lsda : 1;
  uint32_t personality_index : 2;
  uint32_t is_not_function_start : 1;

We probably need a less-restricted version and account for different
architecture needs. The result would still be significantly smaller
than SFrame v2 and the future v3 (unless it's completely rewritten).

We should probably design an optional two-level lookup table mechanism
for additional savings (at the cost of linker friendliness).

The GC issue would not have happened at all if we had used multiple
