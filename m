I patched the IWB driver to work like an MBIgen.

It looks like the msi_prepare() ITS callback (ie where the its_device is
allocated) is called everytime an endpoint device driver requests a
wired IRQ through:

gicv5_its_msi_prepare+0x68c/0x6f8
its_pmsi_prepare+0x16c/0x1b8
__msi_domain_alloc_irqs+0x70/0x448
__msi_domain_alloc_irq_at+0xf8/0x194
msi_device_domain_alloc_wired+0x88/0x10c
irq_create_fwspec_mapping+0x3a0/0x4c0
irq_create_of_mapping+0xc0/0xe8
of_irq_get+0xa0/0xe4
platform_get_irq_optional+0x54/0x1c4
platform_get_irq+0x1c/0x50

so it becomes "shared" if multiple IWB wires are requested by endpoint
drivers.

I don't have an MBIgen enabled platform but I don't see how it could
behave differently but it could be that I have stared at this code
path for too long.

I don't understand then how in the GICv3 ITS we can guarantee that the
eventid we "allocate" for a wire matches the one sent on the MBIgen->ITS
bus. AFAICS, the ITS eventid is an offset from the LPI base that is
allocated dynamically.

Let's say an endpoint driver requires wire X. The ITS, in
its_alloc_device_irq() grabs a bit from the lpi_map bitmap that has
nothing to do with X.

I don't get how the two can be made to match unless we do something
like I am going to do with the IWB.

This, unless mbigen_write_msi_msg() does something with the
X<->{msg->data} translation (if that function does nothing it should be
removed because it is really misleading).

I am sorry to drone on about this but we have been raking our brains
over this and I would like to understand how this works once for all.

Absolutely, that's not what I meant, sorry, I am really really grateful
and honestly very happy about all the help provided.

I was referring to the disgusting OF compatible hack I posted, I really
don't like it (and good news, we don't need it either).

Absolutely, no questions, massive thanks.
