To illustrate - DRAM latency is 30-70n.

At 4GHz, that's 120-280 cycles, and a properly fed CPU can do multiple
instructions per clock - so a cache miss all the way to DRAM can cost
you hundreds of instructions.

The first question is - does it matter? If the optimization is just for
/proc/allocinfo, who's reading it at a high enough rate that we care?

If it's only being used interactively, it doesn't matter. If it's being
read at a high rate by some sort of profiling program, we'd want to skip
the text interface entirely and add an ioctl to read the data out in a
binary format.

The idea of changing seq_file to continue until the user buffer is full
- that'd be a good one, if you're making changes that benefit all
seq_file users.
