This is true, almost all apps I'm aware that are using userfaultfd needs
that.  It's indeed confusing.

IMHO 22e5fe2a2a279 was correct, and it fixed a possible race due to
ctx->state before. The new cmpxchg() plus the INITIALIZED flag should avoid
the race.

In this case it should be the man page that was wrong since this commit of
man page, afaict:

commit a252b3345f5b0a4ecafa7d4fb1ac73cb4fd4877f (HEAD)
Author: Axel Rasmussen <axelrasmussen@google.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 3 12:45:43 2023 -0700

    ioctl_userfaultfd.2: Describe two-step feature handshake

I'll see if Axel / Mike / Andrea has any comment, otherwise I'll propose a
patch to fix the man-pages and state the fact (that we need a sacrificial
fd).

Maybe I should really add the UFFDIO_FEATURES ioctl to allow fetching the
feature flags from kernel separately, considering how much trouble we've
hit with this whole thing..

Thanks,
