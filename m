It's not needed as a safety requirement for implementing the trait. If
the implementation only contains sound code, then `Owned::from_raw`
should already ensure that `Owned<Self>` is only created if there is
exactly one reference to it.

I don't understand this paragraph.

Ah right, I forgot about this. What was the refcount characteristics of
this again?

*  2 =3D in flight, owned by Rust
* >2 =3D in flight, owned by Rust + additional references used by Rust

Correct? Maybe @Andreas can check.

Wait which problems on `ARef` do you mean? I disagree that `Owned` and
`ARef` have the same example. `Owned` should expose operations that
`ARef` can't otherwise there would be no value in using `Owned`.

Just hide those parts behind `#` lines in the example.
