Please start there, don't you want to know why things are failing?

Why are you calling close/open at all?  Why does that do anything?
Doesn't that feel wrong?

Again, please root-cause the failure, don't try to paper over it by
loads of looping and odd open/close attempts that are not understood and
seem to actually cause other types of crashes :)

Yes, why wouldn't you want to do that?
