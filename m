What this tells me is that there wasn't actually any real ask for
this, and you're trying to make up arguments for a silly patch.

First off, "loading a module" and then "the module loads the firmware"
file are *not* two distinct things with distinct security properties.

The module DOES NOT WORK without the firmware file. So the argument
that they are independent action is complete nonsense. If you don't
trust the firmware, then don't load the module. It's that simple.

Second, your argument that there are different tasks involved is true,
but no, that doesn't mean that there are "potentially different
security properties".

Why? Because as mentioned, loading the module very much implies having
to be able to load the firmware for it - but yes, the firmware loading
might actually happen _later_ and in a different and completely
independent context.

In particular, drivers can do their firmware loads at various random times.

Yes, one common situation is that they do it during module load, for
example, in which case it would be done in the same context that the
module load itself happened.

But it's *also* common that it is done asynchronously while scanning
for devices.

Or done when the device is opened.

Or the firmware file is reloaded when the system resumes from suspend,
because the device lost all its context, so now it's reloading
something that it loaded earlier in a very *different* context, and
that had better not start randomly failing resulting in basically
impossible-to-debug resume problems.

In other words, the context of actual firmware loading is pretty much
random. It isn't necessarily tied to the module loading, but it *also*
isn't necessarily tied to a particular other actor.

So any argument that depends on the context of the firmware load is
bogus a priori. Since there isn't some well-defined context the load
happens in, any policy based on such a context is garbage.

To put it bluntly, your whole argument for why separate policy makes
sense seems completely made-up and has no actual reality behind it.

It also very much sounds like this change was *not* triggered by
anybody actually needing it, and as in fact sounds like just "let's
pattern-match and do the same thing for these things that look similar
but aren't".

This is *EXACTLY* the kind of thing that I think the security layers
should absolutely NOT DO.

You should not add nonsensical policy hooks "just because".

Security policy needs to have some thought behind it, not be some
mindless random thing. And there should have been a documented case of
people needing it.

This is literally why I was asking for the reasoning behind that
patch. The patch looked nonsensical. And I have not at all been
convinced otherwise.
