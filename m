Clean and straightforward! I prefer this too ;p

Nice! Seems like a well-balanced solution ;)

Indeed, we should add a deprecation warning. Perhaps the message could say:

"'panic_print=' is deprecated and will be removed. Use 'panic_sys_info=' 
instead."

e.g. pr_warn_ratelimited("block device autoloading is deprecated and will be
removed.\n") in blkdev_get_no_open().

Makes sense to me. BTW, this override behavior needs to be documented
in kernel-doc.

+1 for sysctl.
