The trap entry/exit routine should always take care of trap cases,
whenever the kernel traps, SUM is saved to pt_regs somewhere in the
kernel stack. Yes, a task may be scheduled out after a trap, which is
common, but please be aware of that after scheduling back to the
original task, it then has to execute the trap exit and thus restore
the SUM before going back to the original code (where it receives an
exception).

No, the trap exit always restores the in-context (correct) sstatus back

I am not sure if I understand what FILO is, but the current trap
handling routines do save/restore sstatus, which can be found at
handle_exception and ret_from_exception, as of today.

I agree that we should keep track of sstatus somewhere and be explicit
about what context it tracks.

sstatus not just tracks per-thread status, some are machine-wide.
Though __switch_to are always called with interrupt disabled, I think
conceptually interrupt enable status should not be saved/restore on a
per-thread basis.

Just FYI that some statuses are currently managed by individual
modules (such as the live sstatus.VS are managed in asm/vector.h). We
can discuss what is prefered. The final patch should take care of
this, or should document that VS is managed elsewhere, if we would
like a centralized sstatus management.

Personally, I would prefer a centralized sstatus management that only
touches SUM. This prevents duplicating condition matchings for vector
out to other places. But maybe there are better ways

Thanks,
Andy
