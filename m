I referred to a particular case (isolation) because you said this is your
usecase. You still haven't explained us why the current affinity management for
kthreads doesn't work for you.

For which usecase?

Also kernel threads are special beasts, even some !PF_NO_SETAFFINTIY kthreads
have actual affinity preferences. If they can go through cpusets, this must be
dealt with. And admins will need to know about those affinity preferences for
each kthreads.

Also do we want to be able to expose all the cgroup limits to kthreads? Even
if only cpusets is allowed to have kthreads, does cpusets.mems make
sense to be exposed for example?

If your issue is ever resolved through cpusets, this will have to be maintained
forever with all those subtleties in mind.

I tend to think that CPU isolation is a very straightforward cpusets usecase:
no load balancing, NULL domains and tasks usually don't compete much for the
CPU since the point is to not be disturbed anyway.

And NULL domains already exclude kernel threads, dynamically. So please give
us a compelling reason for doing this.

Thanks.
