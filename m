Which standard events? Going through them (abbreviated to avoid repetition)=
:
 - PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES, ok.
 - PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS, well does that include speculatively
executed instructions or not?
 - ...
 - PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND, what does this count on an
in order CPU?
 - ...

The hardware cache events are far worse as things like LLC mean the L2
cache, however, it is far more typical for this to mean L3 these days.
Standard and clearly defined, sorry absolutely not. They are a
minefield of well intentioned event name components waiting to explode
when a vendor inadvertently creates a combination that happens to
match a combination perf thinks is significant.

There was a similar attempt for raw events where you can go r123 for
the hex 123 event config, it was missed that rEAD is a valid hex raw
event as well as a useful event name. The event parsing now has a lot
of special handling to avoid exploding on this - and yes the priority
is that sysfs/json has priority over the raw event encoding.

We could and it would very likely break tooling. The intent is that
cpu-cycles matches cpu_core/cpu-cycles/ and cpu_atom/cpu-cycles/ and
they are expected to all be the same event. Currently with the PMU
they are sysfs encoded but without a PMU they are legacy encoded but
printed (uniquified) as if they were with a PMU and sysfs encoded.
This is misleading.
