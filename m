Thank you!

So octopus merges of documentation, torture testing, and other things that
are very unlikely to matter for bisection should be fine.  Branches that
are not going to interact should be fine, give or take any uncertainty in
"not going to interact".  No merge conflicts are permitted in octopus
merges.

On the other hand, given that there are cases where octopus merges are
not fine, it might be more straightforward to merge one branch at a time.
The main loss is that remerging after applying fises is a bit easier
with octopus merges, but that isn't a big deal.

So it might be time to say "goodbye" to octopus merges.  I will try
that for v6.18.

Fair point!

And that argues for putting the material that we currently put into the
pull request into the merge commit logs.

Very much so, and again thank you.

Thank you, and as you say, lots of examples.  ;-)
