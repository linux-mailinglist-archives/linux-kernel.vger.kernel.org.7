TFP410 has the EDGE/HTPLG pin, which should be used to monitor DVI /

Hmm? display-connector definitely supports HPD for DVI, HDMI and DP
connectors.

I'm not so sure. eDP / DP link has special meaning for HPD pin, so it
might be worth handling it on both sides. I can imaging the bridge
handling HPD pin to report attention IRQs, while GPIO is used for main
plug / unplug detection.

Connectors can simply skip the hpd-gpios property which should have the
same effect.

Same as above. Connectors don't require special handling for no HPD
case.

see above

I'd say, the driver needs some cleanup, if we are to land this patch.
I'd suggest to rework HPD enablement / disablement to use hpd_enable /
disable functions. Make no-hpd disable OP_HPD. Make actual detect / plug
handling tied to the hpd_notify callback, etc.
