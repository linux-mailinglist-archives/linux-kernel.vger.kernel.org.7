Yes, as long as we can't look at the sg_io_hdr, there is no way to
figure out if we got a path error.

Right, that was my impression, too.

The interfaces could be made look a bit different, and we could return
-EAGAIN to userspace instead of retrying immediately (not that it makes
sense to me, but if that were really the issue, fine with me), but the
core logic with copying the sg_io_hdr, calling sg_io() directly and then
inspecting the status and possibly failing paths would have to be pretty
much the same as you had.

Yes, I agree we should focus on improving what we have, rather than
trying to find another radically different approach that none of us have
thought of before.

If you're talking about SG_IO in dm-mpath, then PRIN/PROUT commands are
actually the one thing that we don't need. libmpathpersist sends the
commands to the individual path devices, so dm-mpath will never see
those. It's mostly about getting the full results on the SCSI level for
normal I/O commands.

There has actually been a patch series on qemu-devel last year (that I
haven't found the time to review properly yet) that would add explicit
persistent reservation operations to QEMU's block layer that could then
be used with the emulated scsi-hd device. On the backend, it only
implemented it for iscsi, but I suppose we could implement it for
file-posix, too (using the same libmpathpersist code as for
passthrough). If that works, maybe at least some users can move away
from SCSI passthrough.

The thing that we need to make sure, though, is that the emulated status
we can expose to the guest is actually good enough. That Paolo said that
the problem with reservation conflicts was mostly because -EBADE wasn't
a thing yet gives me some hope that at least this wouldn't be a problem
any more today.

We would still lose other parts of the SCSI status, so I'm still a bit
cautious here with making a prediction for how many users could
eventually (I expect years) use the emulated device instead and how many
would keep using passthrough even in the long term.
