I can't look it up currently, sorry. That's why I said Philipp will loop you in
once he's back. :)

I mean it should be impossible to have jobs on the pending_list when calling
drm_sched_fini(), but not have memory leaks, unless you let the driver do weird
things, such as peeking into implementation details of the scheduler, etc.

That seems very wrong to me. This is exactly what I mean with the driver peeks
into implementation details.

If the API of a component requires to know about and modify internals of the
component, it's pretty much broken and must be fixed.

That's pretty much what this series does, no? With the new callback the driver
is supposed to kill the corresponding fence context, which signals all
associated fences and hence the pending list will clear subsequently.

Again, I think that's what it does, unless I misunderstand you.
