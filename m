Great! That's exactly what I think the API should look like as well. :-)

We probably still want

	let foo_dir = my_dir.subdir("foo_dir")
	foo_dir.file("foo_file")

for convinience, rather than having to call

	let bar_dir = Dir::new("foo_dir", my_dir)
	File::new("bar_file", bar_dir)

all the time. But otherwise, sounds reasonable to me.

The only thing I don't want to is to allow to leak files or directories, i.e.

	File::new("bar_file", bar_dir).leak()

which keeps the file in the filesystem, but takes away the handle from the Rust
side, such that it won't be removed from the filesystem anymore when the handle
goes out of scope, which can cause nasty bugs. But I think there isn't any
benefit to allow this anyways and it isn't needed with reference counting.

I'm open on things like having "ghost" objects as proposed by Alice or force all
files to be dropped before the directory, etc. though.

Let's see if it actually does, I'm not sure it will be, at least not for all
use-cases. But even if, it's probably worth the extra robustness.

Yes, sounds good to me.
