Yes, as previously mentioned, we run all our tests on multi-core machines. =
Not sure though, what exactly you
are referring to by "global scheduling". Do you mean using Global Earliest =
Deadline First (GEDF)? I guess that
is what SCHED_DEADLINE is using, not?

Concerning the taskset being schedulable, it is not that it does not schedu=
le at all. Remember, from hundreds
of millions of test runs over the course of a full week where we usually se=
e absolutely zero deadline misses
(without reclaim), we see 43 million deadline misses (with that one rogue p=
rocess set to reclaim) on NUC and
600 thousand on ROCK5B (which also has double the CPU cores).

Please let me know if you need any further details which may help figuring =
out what exactly is going on.
