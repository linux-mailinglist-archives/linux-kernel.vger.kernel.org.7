Not sure. I'm also guessing cond_resched is the reason for your
observation, so that might be worth confirming is happening in whatever
IO paths you're workload is taking in case there's some other
explanation.

fs-writeback happens to work around it by unplugging if it knows
cond_resched is going to schedule. The decision to unplug here wasn't
necessarily because of the plug's ktime, but it gets the job done:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/fs/fs-writeback.c?h=v6.15-rc3#n1984

Doesn't really scale well to copy this for every caller of
cond_resched(), though. An io specific helper implementation of
cond_resched might help.

Or if we don't want cond_resched to unplug (though I feel like you would
normally want that), I think we could invalidate the ktime when
scheduling to get the stats to read the current ktime after the process
is scheduled back in.
