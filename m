We first tackled big-endian support on ARM32 nearly 15 years ago, and 
drawing on that experience, we saw value in doing the same work on 
RISC-V as a way for newer engineers to gain hands-on experience 
contributing in the open.

Now weâ€™re starting to see commercial cores on the horizon that will have 
the ability to be endian configured at run-time. For example, MIPS (the 
company not the ISA) has announced they will be producing cores with 
configurable endian (https://mips.com/products/hardware/i8500/).

Note some of the patches we are proposing also make the code better, 
such as swapping .word for .insn.

This feels like the price you pay for making a flexible and free 
ecosystem to build cores. There is no single authority making you use 
every feature that might be specified (although Ubuntu's choice to move 
forward with RVA32 for future is a current pain for anyone who already 
has purchased hardware).

See initial reply for comment on MIPS. We also don't think this a huge 
change and given most projects we worked through had few (if any) issues 
with building big endian, we thought it was worth having an attempt at this.

Thanks, but that isn't helpful and is just making the kernel look more 
toxic. I am however going to wear the "I got ranted at by Linus and 
survived" tag with pride.
