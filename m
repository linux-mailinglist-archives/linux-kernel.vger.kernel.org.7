I have tried to use the drm_bridge_detect() API to do this as 
simple-bridge driver, but it does not work well for bridges that do not 
declare OP_DETECT.

Take nxp-ptn3460 as an example, the connected status will be treated as 
connector_status_unknown via the following call stack:

drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes()
   -> drm_helper_probe_detect()
      -> drm_bridge_connector_detect()
         -> analogix_dp_bridge_detect()
            -> drm_bridge_detect()
               -> return connector_status_unknown due to !OP_DETECT

However, the connected status will be connector_status_connected as 
expected if Analogix DP does not declare OP_DETECT[0]:

drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes()
   -> drm_helper_probe_detect()
      -> drm_bridge_connector_detect()
         -> return connector_status_connected due to CONNECTOR_LVDS

Base on Andy's commit 5d156a9c3d5e ("drm/bridge: Pass down connector to 
drm bridge detect hook"), the drm_connector becomes available in 
drm_bridge_detect().

It may be better to unify the logic of drm_bridge_detect() and 
drm_bridge_connector_detect(), which sets the connected status according 
to the connector_type. Then the codes will be more reasonable and become 
similar to the simple-bridge demo via 
'drm_bridge_detect(dp->plat_data->next_bridge, connector)'.

But we still need a specific check for DP-connector to resolve this 
issue. The '!dp->hpd_gpiod' may not be well-considered. Perhaps we could 
introduce a new API, similar to drm_bridge_is_panel(), called 
drm_bridge_is_display_connector()?

I see... There is also a way to leave the connected status check in 
Analogix DP bridge:

1.If the later bridge does not support HPD function, the 'force-hpd' 
property must be set under the DP DT node. The DT modifications may be
large by this way.
2.If the later bridge do support HPD function like the DP-connector, the
connected status detection method is GPIO HPD or functional pin HPD.

With the DT modifications for above 1, the analogix_dp_bridge_detect() 
can be simplified to:

static enum drm_connector_status
analogix_dp_bridge_detect(struct drm_bridge *bridge, struct 
drm_connector *connector)
{
	struct analogix_dp_device *dp = to_dp(bridge);
	enum drm_connector_status status = connector_status_disconnected;

	if (!analogix_dp_detect_hpd(dp))
		status = connector_status_connected;

	return status;
}

Best regards,
Damon
