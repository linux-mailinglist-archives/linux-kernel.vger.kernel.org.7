Ted, have you read what this thread is about? :)
I was talking only about images that fail fsck.

Re headcount, if we want that to ever happen, shouldn't we do what I proposed?

If we downplay all of these, pretend these don't exist, and argue it's
not important in any context, unsurprisingly nobody is willing to
allocate a headcount to fix this "unimportant nothing".
