Okay, for now keep the MP_STATE_INIT_RECEIVED ioctl()

The SBI HSM virtualization does not need any KVM userspace
involvement.

When a VCPU stops itself using SBI HSM stop(), the Guest itself
provides the entry address and argument when starting the VCPU
using SBI HSM start() without any KVM userspace involvement.

In fact, even at Guest boot time all non-boot VCPUs are brought-up
using SBI HSM start() by the boot VCPU where the Guest itself
provides entry address and argument without any KVM userspace
involvement.

Okay, nothing to be done on this front.

For SBI HSM, the kernel space should be the only entity managing.

For the unspecified parts, we have KVM exits at appropriate places
e.g. SBI system reset, SBI system suspend, etc.
