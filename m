What?  No, we do this for many subsystems already.  Look at the entry
for "USB TYPEC BUS FOR ALTERNATE MODES" as one simple example.  The
patches go to the list, Heikki reviews them and if he says "ack" or
"signed-off-by" then I pick them up and add them to my tree and away the
patch goes.

That last bit is NOT explicitly documented in MAINTAINERS as it does not
need to be (otherwise you will have too many lines in that file).  This
is just one more subsystem that does it this way, not a big deal.

They are "handling" them in that they are reviewing them when they get
the chance and then I need to then pick them up.  Again, totally normal.

I will not dispute the fact that this is confusing for submitters, and
maybe the cdx maintainers need to get a tree and start doing more work,
but I am NOT going to be the one telling any maintainer to do more work
than they are willing to do as that would just be rude :)
