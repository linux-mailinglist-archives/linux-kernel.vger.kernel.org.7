Ah yes, I initially thought by break you meant they were failing. I saw that,
will fix it.

Sure will change next revision to RFC, unless hopefully maybe we can

Yes ofcourse! I mean all maintainers :)

This is probably a very basic question, but by make mm_struct->flags 64-bit on 32-bit
do you mean convert flags to unsigned long long when !CONIFG_64BIT?

I see a few of the PR_GET_.. setting the return value. I hope I didnt
misinterpret that.

So if __mmap_new_vma and do_brk_flags are called after merge attempt,
is it possible to vma_set_thp_policy (or do something similar) before
the merge attempt?


Actually I just read your reply to the next block, so I think its ok?
Added more to the next block.

I dont have any preference on where its put, so happy with putting this
earlier.

Ofcourse!

Appreaciate it!

I am actually not familiar with the merge code. I will try and have a look,
but if you could give a pointer to the file:line after which its not acceptable
to have and I can move vma_set_thp_policy to before it or try and do something
similar to that.
