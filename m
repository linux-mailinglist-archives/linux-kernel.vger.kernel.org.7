I had covered this case in my previous email already. This flag is
only used by begin_new_exec(), and the only consequence is resetting
pdeath_signal (point 4) and stack limit reset (point 5). I thought
both are no deal at all for the second exec - or are they? I don't
know.

I don't see this document describing the purpose anywhere. It only
states that bprm_set_creds should set it "if a secure exec has
happened" but doesn't say what a "secure exec" is, and doesn't say
what is supposed to happen when it's set.

Is it really a "secureexec" if executing a non-suid program while
having effective!=3Dreal? (Currently: true, my patch: false)
Is it really a "secureexec" if executing a suid program but no actual
uid/gid changes occurred (no-op) because they're the same as before
(and no capabilities raised)? (Currently: true, my patch: false)

How would resetting pdeath_signal and stack limit affect this problem?

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is an environment variable that's used by the
userspace linker, not by the kernel. Userspace doesn't have access to
the "secureexec" flag. The usual protection against
LD_LIBRARY_PATH/LD_PRELOAD attacks is that the glibc ld.so ignores (or
removes?) these when it observes real!=3Deffective. That check still
works with my patch, and has nothing to do with the "secureexec" flag,
does it?

Yes, I understand your worries, and I can limit my patch to the
NO_NEW_PRIVS case, if you prefer that. But I think it is worth
exploring the legacy behavior and see if there is really a problem
(i.e. if there is really a userspace-visible effect), and if that
legacy behavior really makes sense. To me, it seems like the legacy
code doesn't make much sense; the checks for "secureexec" are wrong
currently, and maybe we can fix this without adding more complexity,
but by cutting unnecessary complexity away. Simpler code that is
easier to understand is less likely to have vulnerabilities.
