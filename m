Hi Ingo,

Thanks for sharing your opinion.

Sorry for the confusion.  I know I'm terrible at naming things. :)

Actually Dmitry used the term 'wall-clock' profiling at first when he
implemented this feature but I thought it was not clear how it meant
for non-cycle events.  As 'overhead' is also a generic term, we ended
up with 'latency'.

Thanks for your seggestions.  My main concern is that it's not just
about cpu-time and wallclock-time.  perf tools can measure any events
that have different meanings.  So I think we need generic terms to cover
them.

Thanks,
