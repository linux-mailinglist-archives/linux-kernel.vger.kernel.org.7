Yeah, I was also in the middle of looking at this after managing to hit 
it playing with driver_async_probe at the end of last week. I guess when 
I originally wrote this pattern I was maybe thinking the compiler would 
defer the to_x_driver() computation to the point it's eventually 
dereferenced, but I suppose it can't since dev is passed to an external 
function in program order in between.

Indeed in my half-written version of this patch I was leaning towards 
removing the drv variable altogether (just doing 
to_x_driver(dev->driver)->driver_managed_dma inline), or at least doing 
the same as Will's previous diff. I figure the one-liner replacing 
"!dev->driver" with "!&drv->driver" would be too disgustingly 
non-obvious for anyone else's tastes...

For consistency we should really fix all the buses the same way - sorry 
for the bother (I can write up the other patches if you'd like). FWIW 
this part really was the most temporary stopgap, as my planned next step 
is to propose moving driver_managed_dma and the use_default_domain() 
call up into the driver core and so removing all this bus-level code 
anyway, hence trying to minimise the effort spent churning it. Oh well.

Beware this might annoy a different set of people as it's not paired 
with a WRITE_ONCE(), but for now I guess using it is still arguably 
better than not. Really we should be under device_lock at this point and 
so have no race at all, but we can't do that without keeping track of 
which devices are IOMMUs themselves to avoid deadlock, and that's not 
something I fancy throwing out as an -rc fix in a hurry...

Thanks,
Robin.
