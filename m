I agree that it doesn't make sense for a system integrator to have two remoteproc firmware
loading services supported from two different TEEs running as Secure Partitions.
After all, one service exposed by one TEE is good enough for fulfilling any use-case.

My concern is that ARM FF-A makes its possible to have a platform running two TEEs, which
each have their own remoteproc firmware authentication service implemented (as usually TEEs do).
In such a scenario, when both TEEs enumerate their services on the TEE bus, and find a match
because the rproc_tee_id_table has a UUID for say, both the TS-TEE remoteproc service and
OP-TEE remoteproc service, rproc_tee_probe() will be called twice, and the current implementation
will break because it uses a single static rproc_tee_ctx, whose contents would be overwritten
leading to unexpected scenarios.

And so, should TEE subsystem clients (like this one) be prepared to handle such as scenario?

Thanks,
