Hi Oliver and Marc,

Thanks for the detailed feedback.

Regarding motivation, this patch is intended to give a userspace vmm
the ability to handle non-ISV guest faults. The Arm Arm (DDI 0487L.b,
section B3.13.6) notes that for load/store pair faults, the syndrome
may not provide the specifics of the access that faulted. In those
cases, the vmm must manually decode the instruction to emulate it. The
introduction of KVM_CAP_ARM_NISV_TO_USER
(https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20191120164236.29359-2-maz@kernel.org/)
seems to have anticipated that flow by allowing exits to userspace on
trapped NISV instructions. What is still missing is a reliable way for
userspace to query VA->IPA translations in order to complete emulation.

> Please do selftests changes in a separate patch.

Ack, will split the kernel changes and selftests into 1/2 and 2/2.

Thanks for the reference, I wasn't aware of this. I'll drop the bespoke 
VHE/NVHE paths and use the shared S1 walker in v2.

I'll switch internal naming to VA/IPA. For uAPI, I'll retain the field
for compatibility and translate internally.

Ack, will use write_sysreg_hcr().

Understood. v2 will rely on the shared walker to avoid missing S1PIE/S1POE.

v2 will use __kvm_at() and the fallback software walk.

I'll add support for the additional bit (execute and EL0) in v2.

My intent is for this ioctl to be side-effect free with no AF updates 
and guest-visible TLB fills. I’ll send v2 as two patches with the above
changes.

Thanks,
Priscilla
