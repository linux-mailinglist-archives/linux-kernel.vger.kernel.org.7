Historically they weren't really leaks either, just spare references on 
a device which at that point could definitely never go away. I suppose 
now that we finally have the .of_xlate calls in IOMMU registration, it 
would be possible for some error during probe to cause the IOMMU driver 
to fail to bind, at which point the references could rightly be 
considered leaked, however these are all embedded platforms with 
essentially zero chance of platform device hotplug, especially not of 
IOMMU devices, so realistically those references still don't matter to 
anything other than code checkers.

In summary; meh.

The SMMU drivers are really doing the same thing, they just defer that 
lookup operation to .probe_device time (largely for historical reasons, 
I think), and they use bus_find_device_by_node() rather than the 
specific of_ version since they support ACPI too. And they do happen to 
include the put_device(), since apparently I was paying full attention 
that day.

It's not racy; if we're calling the .of_xlate op (or really any op for 
that matter), it's because an IOMMU driver has registered (or is 
registering) for the given fwnode, which means it is bound to the 
corresponding struct device. Thus as above, in that context said struct 
device, nor said IOMMU driver's drvdata, ain't goin' nowhere.

Thanks,
Robin.
