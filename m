I don't think there ever was anything secret, and I don't understand
why it was ever taken off-list. My initial post was public and it
already contained everything.
(My reply will go back to LKML and a full quote of your email to give
context to those who were excluded from this private thread. I assume
you're fine with that?)

Why would it be a bug? If a program doesn't use or care for
LD_PRELOAD, why would it need to clear environment variables that may
or may be used by other arbitrary programs? Is every program
responsible for clearing sensitive environment variables for every
other program on the planet? (I'm stretching this for the sake of the
argument, but I hope you get my basic idea.)

We agree that AT_SECURE has been the canonical Linux-specific way for
this check for at least 20 years.

Yes, everybody should have an #ifdef __linux__ with this check instead
of geteuid()!=3Dgetuid(). But that's not the reality we're living in.
Did you know that not even util-linux and e2fsprogs get this right?
Look at:

- https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/pull/3566
- https://github.com/tytso/e2fsprogs/pull/226

(I posted patches to a bunch of projects to get userspace fixed.
Others that don't get it right include: cups, libevent, Firefox, Qt,
Chromium, GnuPG, krb5, Postfix, Mono, iptables and many many others.)

The reality is that knowledge of the existence of AT_SECURE has
propagated only to a tiny bubble, and the majority of people have
never heard of it.

That alone would not justify fixing the NO_NEW_PRIVS behavior; but it
looks like the NO_NEW_PRIVS behavior was initially an undesired side
effect of a broken setuid check in the kernel. What the kernel does
here is not documented, and neither does it make sense. This is really
why I argue that the kernel should be fixed. If it doesn't make sense
AND breaks userspace, there is really only one way to fix it. But
that's just my opinion.

One can define NO_NEW_PRIVS this way (though I don't agree that it
should be), but that is not how it is documented currently. And the
name NO_NEW_PRIVS doesn't even remotely imply this behavior; you argue
for taking away privileges, but the name says no new privileges shall
be granted; keeping existing privileges is that.

For better NO_NEW_PRIVS documentation, please consider merging my
patch: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250509184105.840928-1-max.kellermann@=
ionos.com/

In any case, I will keep my "ids identical" patch (with "secureexec"
bug fix) in our private kernel fork, because we need this behavior,
one way or another, but there is only this way. Thanks to everybody
who participated in the discussion - I really learned something here,
and that helped me understand the "secureexec" mistake in my patch.
