I think we should name this file `owned.rs` instead. It's also what
we'll have for `ARef` when that is moved to `sync/`.

Also, I do wonder does this really belong into the `types` module? I
feel like it's becoming our `utils` module and while it does fit, I
think we should just make this a top level module. So
`rust/kernel/owned.rs`. Thoughts?

I think it's a good idea to expand the docs here a bit.

This seems wrong, `var: Owned<T>` should life until `min(var, T)`, so
whatever is earlier: until the user drops the `var` or `T`'s lifetime
ends.

How about we just say:

    Type allocated and destroyed on the C side, but owned by Rust.

We shouldn't call this a reference. Also we should start the first
paragraph with how this trait enables the usage of `Owned<Self>`.

I think this is more confusing than helpful. We should mention
`AlwaysRefCounted`, but the phrasing needs to be changed. Something
along the lines: if you need reference counting, implement
`AlwaysRefCounted` instead.

This invariant sounds weird to me. It's vague "a state which the kernel
expects" and difficult to use (what needs this invariant?).

Let's remove the part in parenthesis.

How about:

    Type allowing mutable access via [`Owned<Self>`].

Can't we implicitly pin `Owned`?

How about

    An owned `T`.

I don't think we need to say this, I always assume this for all Rust
types except they document otherwise (eg `ManuallyDrop`, `MaybeUninit`
and thus also `Opaque`.)

How about we provide some examples here?

What exactly is "owned" supposed to mean? It depends on the concrete `T`
and that isn't well-defined (since it's a generic)...

Maybe we should give `Ownable` the task to document the exact ownership
semantics of `T`?

How does this amount to sending a `&mut T`?

I guess this also needs to be guaranteed by `Owned::from_raw`... ah the
list grows...

I'll try to come up with something to simplify this design a bit wrt the
safety docs.

Same here.

This doesn't follow for me. Well the first issue is that the safety
invariant of `Self` isn't well-defined, so let's revisit this when that
is fixed.
