If we can't prove it does not have security impact in any context,
then the safe default would be to say it's unsafe.
That's the current Kernel CNA approach, right. It creates a super set
of any issues that may be relevant in some context.

Indeed. And for that we need to flag it as a potential vulnerability
in the first place.

But the current rule says it's not a vulnerability for any possible
user and use case out there.
