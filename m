The general answer is "you better know the copyright ownership
information of the output of the tool you use" before you do anything
with any of these tools.  Be careful about this, because adding your
signed-off-by to a patch like makes it your responsibility :)

After that, treat it like any other tool that you use to generate a
patch, document what you used and why/how, and you should be fine.  You
have to do this today if you were to use any type of tool, so in that
way, "AI" is no different, with the exception of the ownership of the
output result (again, consult the terms of the tool used.)

Hopefully documentation updates to our process documents will reflect
this in the near future.
