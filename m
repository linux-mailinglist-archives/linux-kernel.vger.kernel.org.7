One of the reasons we treak BRK as an NMI is that exception entry for
BRK will leave all DAIF bits set, whereas schedule() should be called
with debug and SError unmasked (but IRQ+FIQ masked). Generally, calling
ct_nmi_enter() prevents preemption (and hence calls to schedule()).

Another is that we may have a BUG() or WARN() in entry code where the
task could be in an inconsistent state, and we need to treat the
exception like an NMI to avoid consuming that inconsistent state.

To handle that properly, we need to:

(a) Figure out what to do with entry code. Last I looked I was under the
    impression that x86 either didn't have a problem here, or simply
    ignored it.

(b) Handle BUG/WARN traps separately from other BRKs, such that we can
    use local_daif_inherit(), and treat this as a special function call
    rather than an NMI.

(c) Somehow teach make_task_dead() to handle the case where DAIF.D
    and/or DAIF.A are set. Most likely we simply have to panic() here,
    as with BUG() in interrupt context.

As above, I do not think that this is sufficient.

The idea is that Ada's series will make it *possible* to handle this
correctly.

As-is, I think an extra warning in the case of a BUG() is fine given
the larger functional issues.

I do not think this patch is correct as-is.

Mark.
