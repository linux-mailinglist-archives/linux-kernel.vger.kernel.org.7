Yeah, the dot was more easily understood at one point but then I decided
I wanted to wrestle the layout and add backedges and then not make the
backedges look horrible. Now it's a mess. I think I can easily be
convinced to replace it with ASCII art in literal blocks. On that note,
I wonder if there is a tool to translate simple ASCII graphs into dot
and then whatever output from that, which would be the ideal solution
here to encode semantic meaning for both audiences.

I'll definitely drop the back edges from the diagrams though, they
only make things more confusing.

I think that's a good idea once the new documentation exhaustively
covers everything. Pulling it into both places generates warnings,
which is why I didn't do it for the functions I already did document.
And doing it only for some and not others needlessly spreads things
out across two pages, though maybe this is best dealt with having a
"dumping ground" in each section for other functions related to that
section, so that we have an exhaustive function listing even if no
usage examples are provided.

I will work on a v2 today which addresses your concerns, and expands
on the documentation to also include some list modification functions.
