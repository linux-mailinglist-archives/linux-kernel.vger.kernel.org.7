Redundant if you are just using the .sha1 files, yes.  Not if you use
the .dyad files which show you exactly what you came up with here.

So for now, let's leave the .sha1 file alone, as without that second
commit in there, the tools can not figure out what you just determined
above in a programatic way.  Or if you think they can, hey, patches are
always gladly accepted!  The tools are now in rust, not crazy bash, with
a regression test suite, and any help is always welcome.

It is a stable-specific CVE.  It's not the first time we've had this,
and will probably not be the last.

Hopefully you all have the same tooling in place that we've created to
dig through the git repo to track what has been backported where.  But
again, if not, feel free to use the .dyad files which show you all of
the needed information in a machine readable format :)
