We have many cases where there are cyclic links in the DeviceTree
representation - clock controllers depending on clock providers that
depend on the same clock controller, regulators being supplied by
regulators of the same PMIC etc.

From a DeviceTree point of view this looks quite similar, but from an
implementation perspective this is simpler than those examples - we
don't even need to do async resolution per resource here.

fw_devlink is supposed to optimize the probe order, it must not prevent
the system from booting just because there is cyclic dependencies
between IP-blocks.

If fw_devlink is authoritative in determining which order things must
happen, then it needs to deal with these things.

This doesn't scale to any example where you have more than single
resources laid out in a convenient order.

This is clearly implementation-driven. Until fw_devlink "forced" you
into this model we considered APCS KPSS global to be one entity.

This is just a pragmatic variant of above.
