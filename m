It's pretty close.  A few more details would be helpful, e.g. to explain that VMMs
may use write() to populate the initial image

Hmm, I think if you want to exclude read() support, the changelog should explicitly
state why.  E.g. "there's no use case" is quite different from "deliberately
don't support read() for security reasons".

No capability is necessary, see d2042d8f96dd ("KVM: Rework KVM_CAP_GUEST_MEMFD_MMAP
into KVM_CAP_GUEST_MEMFD_FLAGS").

The restriction should be that guest memory must be SHARED, i.e. not PRIVATE.
Strictly speaking, guest memory can be encrypted, e.g. with SME and TME (I think
TME is still a thing?), but with a shared key and thus accessible from the host.

Even if that weren't the case, we want to support this for CoCo VMs.

Why?  (Honest question, e.g. is that standard file semantics?)

I want to be cautious with respect to the ABI/uAPI.  Patrick's series also adds
a flag, and guest_memfd doesn't currently provide a way to toggle flags after the
file is created.  That begs the question of how GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_NO_DIRECT_MAP
will co-exist with GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_WRITE.  Presumably the goal is to use write()
to initialize memory, and _then_ nuke the direct map.

I want line of sight to understanding the exact semantics/flows.  E.g. will KVM
require userspace to clear GUEST_MEMFD_FLAG_WRITE before allowing
NO_DIRECT_MAP?  Or will the write() simply fail?  How will the sequencing be
achieved?

No.  As above, write() should be allowed iff memory is SHARED.  Relevant commits
that are now in Linus' tree:
