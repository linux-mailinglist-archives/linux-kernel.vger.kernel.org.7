Thank you for sharing these details!

It sounds like you are using DAMOS without any quota, and the target workload
has static memory mapping.  Hence all migrations for the new weights can be
completed after one DAMOS schemes apply interval, and no more migration will
happen until new weights are given.  And that's why you want
wait_for_schemes_apply, since when the command is finished is when all new
weights based interleaving is done.  Am I understanding correctly?

Sounds suboptimal work arounds for you...

Great to hear this, and I agree.  The commit operation internally uses
damon_call(), which takes up to one sampling interval.  Also the migration
operation that you will wait for would also take no small time, depending on
the amount of pages to migrate.  Compared to those, I think the commit speed
increase due to committing unnecessary paramters may relatively short.
deal.

Meanwhile, I was concerning the continuous next_{aggregation,ops_update_}sis
delay could be a real problem.  And this option should solve the real problem.

If my above theory is not wrong, I'd suggest making the commit operation
optimization.  If it turns out to be not enough for your or others' use cases,
we can further consider commit_schemes.

I'm glad to hear we found a way to go.  As you may know,
update_schemes_tried_bytes would be more efficient, so I would suggest that
more than update_schemes_tried_regions.

If the wait is not strictly need to be accurate, maybe monitoring the DAMOS
scheme stats in auto-update mode[1] until any change is made could also be a
way.  The stat update for a scheme will be done only after the scheme is
applied to all applicable regions for a round.

Thank you again for kindly sharing your use case and participate in this
constructive discussion :)
