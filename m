Indeed, the fact that the kernel was built with the option enabled says 
nothing at all about the needs of whatever system we're actually running 
on, so that's definitely wrong. This one is also the kind of option 
which may well be enabled in a multi-platform distro kernel, since it 
only adds a tiny amount of code with no functional impact on systems 
which don't explicitly opt in, but offers a useful benefit to those 
which can and do.

Furthermore, the justification doesn't add up at all - if the relevant 
devices could use the per-NUMA-node CMA areas, then... why not just have 
them use the per-NUMA-node CMA areas, no kernel change needed (and maybe 
a slight performance bonus too)? On the other hand, where those areas 
may or may not be allocated is entirely meaningless to NUMA_NO_NODE 
devices which wouldn't use them anyway.

TBH given that the command-line parameter can specify placement as well 
as size, I think it would make a lot of sense to allow that to override 
the default limit provided by the arch code. That would give users the 
most flexibility, at the minor cost of having to accept the consequences 
if they do specify something which ends up not working for some devices. 
Otherwise I fear that any attempt to make the code itself cleverer will 
just lead down a rabbit-hole of trying to second-guess the user's intent 
- if the size doesn't fit the limit, who says it's right to increase the 
limit rather than reduce the size? And so on...

Thanks,
Robin.
