Regarding the address_unit approach, I have some concerns after checking
the code:

1. Scaling Factor Limitations - While the scaling factor resolves the
damon_addr_range storage issue, actual physical addresses (PAs) would
still require unsigned long long temporaries in many cases.  Different
system with varying iomem regions may require different scaling
factors, making deployment harder than a fixed maximum range.

2. Significant Code Impact & Overhead - Implementing this would require
significant changes with every PA traversal needing rescaling, which
introduces computational overhead. That said, there remains a necessity
to use unsigned long long to store certain variables in structures, such
as sampling_addr in the damon_region structure and sz_tried in the
damos_stat structure.

If I'm misunderstanding any points, please correct me, and feel free to
add any additional concerns.

As an alternative, we could adopt a pattern similar to other subsystems
(e.g., memblock, CMA, resource), which define their own address types.
For example:

  #ifdef CONFIG_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT
	typedef unsigned long long damon_addr_t;
  #else
	typedef unsigned long damon_addr_t;
  #endif

This approach would avoid scaling complexity while maintaining
consistency with existing mm code.

What do you think? SJ, I'm happy to help test any approach or discuss
further.
