Hi,

Just a thought, but I think that while it's not possible to be fully
generic, a parameter model along the lines of

	quantity = raw_value * ((double)multiplier / divisor) * BASE_UNIT

would cover most things that we have or can reasonably foresee,
including memory bandwidth control values.
raw_value, multiplier and divisor would all be integers.

Since raw_integer can be the value used by the hardware, its precision
can probably be fixed at 1, though we could still report it explicitly.

Fundamental base units would be things like "byte", "bytes per second"
and "none" (i.e., dimensionless quantities).  (Are there others?)


Since we cannot guess for certain what userspace wants to do with the
values, it feels better to let userspace do any scaling calculations
itself, rather than trying to prettify the interface.

For example: scaling memory bandwidth percentages for MPAM is a
nuisance because the hardware uses fixed-point values scaled by a power
of 2, not by 100: the two scales can never match up anywhere except at
multiples of 25%, leading to irregular increments when rounded to an
integer percentage value and uncertainty about what the bandwidth_gran
parameter means.  Round-trip conversions between the two
representations become error-prone due to repeated rounding -- this
proved quite fiddly to get right.  Precision beyond 1% increments may
also be available in the hardware, but is not accessible through the
resctrl interface.

For backwards compatibility we probably shouldn't change that
particular interface, but if we can avoid new instances of the same
kind of problem then that would be a benefit: i.e., explicitly tell
userspace how to scale a given parameter.

Cheers
