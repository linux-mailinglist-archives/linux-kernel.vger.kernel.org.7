Sampling is disabled when ProfilingBufferEnabled() = false (look at the
pseudocode for SPEPreExecution() in the Arm ARM).  ProfilingBufferEnabled() =
false if PMBLIMITR_EL1.E = 0 *or* PMBSR_EL1.S = 1.

One way to think about it is: if PMBLIMITR_EL1.E = 0, then there's no point in
sampling instructions and creating records because the profiling unit cannot
write them to memory; and if PMBSR_EL1.S = 1, something went wrong with the
buffer, or the buffer is full, and similarly there's no point in sampling
instructions and creating records because, again, the profiling unit cannot
write them to memory.

DDI 0487L.a, rule R_BWCFK: If the Effective value of SCTLR_ELx.EOS is 1, the
exception return is a Context synchronization event.

Linux always sets EOS.
