I do not know, but it was not threaded :(

Try sending it to yourself and see if the delay maybe caused a problem?
there should not be an issue sending just 3 messages at once.

6.1 is very old, please try the latest 6.17.y release, or 6.18-rc1.
Lots and lots of RT stuff has been fixed since 6.1.

I'm saying that the RT selection should cause you not to have those
larger variants in delays.  Try a newer kernel and see.

True, which is something that the rt changes should have addressed.
This sounds like an overall rt issue, not a serial port issue.  Have you
asked about this on the rt mailing list?

This should come from a hardware definition somewhere in your DT, not as
a user-selectable option.  And again, why not just tie it to the cpu
where the irq came from automatically?

That's a system design issue, not a kernel issue :)
