page_expected_state() is called both at free and alloc.  I think
the correct behaviour on encountering a HWPOISON page should be
different at alloc and free, don't you?

If it's a reasonable optimisation, absolutely!  But if it's an
optimisation, it should be accompanied with a benchmark showing an
improvement.  As far as improving readability, I'm not yet convinced
that you have the expertise to make that call.  Every change that is
made invalidates everybody else's mental model of "how this works".
So all changes carry a cost.  Sometimes that cost is worth paying,
other times it isn't.

There is no process!  Choose a patch, read it, think about it.  What
problems might there be with it?  What may have been overlooked?
Is the commit message unclear to you, how could it be improved?
When you're done, send a Reviewed-by: tag (read the kernel process
documents for the full meaning of that tag).
