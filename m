So far I was able to reenable MBM on AMD implementations (for some
users) while deferring on the counter assignment interface discussion
by just making shared assignment the default for newly-created groups.
Until they want to upgrade assignments to exclusive or break down
traffic with multiple counters to watch a particular group more
closely, they won't need to change any assignments.

Just pointing out that this turned out to be a useful first step in
deploying ABMC support.

I'll try to identify any issues I've encountered with "soft-ABMC".
Hopefully I'll be able to share a sample implementation based on these
patches soon.

There's now more interest in Google for allowing explicit control of
where RMIDs are assigned on Intel platforms. Even though the number of
RMIDs implemented by hardware tends to be roughly the number of
containers they want to support, they often still need to create
containers when all RMIDs have already been allocated, which is not
currently allowed. Once the container has been created and starts
running, it's no longer possible to move its threads into a monitoring
group whenever RMIDs should become available again, so it's important
for resctrl to maintain an accurate task list for a container even
when RMIDs are not available.

Earlier I discussed with Reinette[1] what num_mbm_cntrs should
represent in a "soft-ABMC" implementation where assignment is
implemented by assigning an RMID, which would result in all events
being assigned at once.

My main concern is how many "counters" you can assign by assigning
RMIDs. I recall Reinette proposed reporting the number of groups which
can be assigned separately from counters which can be assigned.

IIUC, this needs to be implemented now so you can drop BMEC with this serie=
s?

To confirm, would we have "mbm_<resource_name>_assignments" for each
resource where MBM-ish events could be assigned?

For soft-ABMC assignment, is there just a single event configuration
representing all the events tracked by the RMID?

These look like the BMEC event names converted from camel case. Will
event filter programming be portable?
