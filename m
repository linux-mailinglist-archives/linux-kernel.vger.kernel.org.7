Except that you might not have a working two stage iommu everywhere
anyway.  So fix it for real to cover all these cases and skip your
layering violations as a nice little benefit.

That shoudn't matter.  No interface should grow stupid hacks ever just
to support legacy guests.  Get the interface right first and then
implement it in all places you need.

Don't go there, that just gets us stupid crap like the Intel hiding
NVMe behind AHCI hack or PCIe firmware first error handling.

Get the interface right and then work on making it fit later.

A per-device flag is probably fine and easier for some things like
pool sizing.  It also would be worse for other things like eventually
implementing percpu pools.

Yeah.  Similar what we do with the generic shared-dma-pool.

As said before they really need system level awareness of a coco host.
That's not something to be hacked into virtio drivers.
