But then we'll still have to disable the feature if one of the early
CPUs doesn't have it. As a local CPU feature as per the errata handling,
the feature (bug) is advertised if at least one CPU supports it. Here we
kind of need a combination of system (available an all early CPUs) and
local MIDR check.

We might be able to work with two features - one SCOPE_SYSTEM for the
sanitised ID reg and a _negative_ (deny-list) SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU for the
MIDR. Or probably a single CPU-local feature, but negative, that checks
both the ID reg and MIDR, let's call it ARM64_HAS_NO_BBML2_NOABORT. If a
single CPU does not have the ID reg or is on the MIDR deny-list, this
"feature" will be enabled. For late CPUs, if NO_BBML2_NOABORT has been
enabled, they are allowed to miss it (OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU). However,
if NO_BBML2_NOABORT is cleared, a late CPU is not allowed to have it.

Hmm, if I got the logic right, that's what
ARM64_CPUCAP_LOCAL_CPU_ERRATUM means but we need to negate the feature
to disable the optimisation if at least one CPU is on the deny-list or
missing BBML2.

(or maybe I haven't had enough coffee today)
