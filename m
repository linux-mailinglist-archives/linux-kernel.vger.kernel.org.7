This is analogous to what the MPAM spec says, though if resctrl offers
two different schemata for the same hardware control, the control cannot be
configured with both values simultaneously.

For the MPAM hardware controls affecting the same hardware resource,
they can be programmed to combinations of values that have no sensible
interpretation, and the values can be read back just fine.  The
performance effects may not be what the user expected / wanted, but
this is not directly visible to resctrl.

So, if we offer independent schemata for MBW_MIN and MBW_MAX, the user
can program MBW_MIN=75% and MBW_MAX=25% for the same PARTID, and that
will read back just as programmed.  The architecture does not promise
what the performance effect of this will be, but resctrl does not need
to care.

Agreed.  I wasn't meaning to imply that this proposal shouldn't be
integrated into something more general.  If we want a richer
description than the current one, it makes sense to incorporate bitmap
controls -- this just wasn't my focus.

Separate files works quite well for low-tech tooling built using shell
scripts, and this seems to follow the sysfs philosophy.  Since there is
no need to keep re-reading these parameters, simplicity feels more
important than efficiency?

But we could equally have a single file with multiple pieces of
information in it.

I don't have a strong view on this.

I had not considered that the info/ directories correspond to resources,
not individual schemata...

I see no reason not to do that.  Either way, older userspace just
ignores the new files and directories.

Perhaps add an intermediate subdirectory to clarify the relationship
between the resource dir and the individual schema descriptions?

This may also avoid the new descriptions getting mixed up with the old
description files.

Say,

  info
  â”œâ”€â”€ MB
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ resource_schemata
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MB
  â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ map
  â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ max
  â”‚   â”†   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ min
  â”‚       â”‚   â”†
  â”†       â”‚
          â”œâ”€â”€ MB_HW
          â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ map
          â”‚   â”†
          â”†

Yup.

Since we have no way to know what vendor-specific controls look like or
what they mean, we can't do much about this.

So, it's the vendor's job to implement support for it, and we might
still say no (if there is no sane way to integrate it).

Since MB is described by the existing files and the documentation,
perhaps this it doesn't need an additional description.

Alternatively though, could we just have a special schema_type for this,
and omit the other properties?  This would mean that we at least have
an entry for every schema.

The '#' wasn't meant to be a state that gets turned on and off.

Rather, userspace would use this to indicate which entries are
intentionally being modified.

So long as the entries affecting a single resource are ordered so that
each entry is strictly more specific than the previous entries (as
illustrated above), then reading schemata and stripping all the hashes
would allow a previous configuration to be restored; to change just one
entry, userspace can uncomment just that one, or write only that entry
(which is what I think we should recommend for new software).

Possibly.  Since this is a boolean control that determines how the
MBW_MAX control is applied, we could perhaps present it as an
additional schema -- if so, it's basically orthogonal.

 | MB_HARDMAX: 0=0, 1=1, 2=1, 3=0 [...]

or

 | MB_HARDMAX: 0=off, 1=on, 2=on, 3=off [...]

Does this look reasonable?

I don't know whether we have a clear use case for this today, and like
almost everything else in MPAM, implementing it is optional...

Ack.  Perhaps we could recommend it, though.

(At the very least, avoiding writing redundant entries would be a
little more efficient for the user.)

Probably not.  These are best regarded as entirely separate instances
of MPAM; the PARTID spaces are separate.  The Non-secure physical
address space is the only physical address space directly accessible to
Linux -- for the others, we can't address the MMIO registers anyway.

For now, the other address spaces are the firmware's problem.

MPAM doesn't allow different controls for a PARTID depending on the
exception level, but it is possible to program different PARTIDs for
hypervisor/kernel and userspace (i.e., EL2/EL1 and EL0).

I think that if we wanted to go down that road, we would want to expose
additional "task IDs" in resctrlfs that can be placed into groups
independently, say

	echo 14161:kernel >>.../some_group/tasks
	echo 14161:user >>.../other_group/tasks

However, inside the kernel, the boundary between work done on behalf of
a specific userspace task, work done on behalf of userspace in general,
and autonomous work inside the kernel is fuzzy and not well defined.

For this reason, we currently only configure the PARTID for EL0.  For
EL1 (and EL2 if the kernel uses it), we just use the default PARTID (0).

Hopefully this is orthogonal to the discussion of schema descriptions,
though ...?

Cheers
