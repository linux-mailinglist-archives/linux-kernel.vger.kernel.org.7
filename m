Please mention that in the commit message. As-is, the commit message has
no rationale for changing to u64.

More generally, if you need to make a change to avoid a compiler
warning, please describe that as part of the rationale.

Sure, but that wasn't my complaint.

My complaint was that it was a logically unrelated change, because you
had provided no rationale as for why it was necessary to change to u64
as a conseqeunce of changing to the generated MDSCR_EL1_* definitions.

Please also note that *almost all* system registers have the
"${REGISTER} is a 64-bit register wording", including things like DAIF,
SPSel, etc. It's necessary to consider the context of use.

Mark.
