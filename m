I added this as docs since I wanted it to be a bit more visible,
but I can replace the comment text (about `UnsafeCell`) with this paragraph
and drop it from the docs if you want.

I already wrote about this in comments (and documentation in this version)
on the `UnsafePinned` type definition.

I'm not sure where exactly we want to have this, but I think having it
at the top of the file and on the type definition is a bit redundant.

I think I should still add a comment there.

I only included the functions that we needed for `Opaque` and my
`miscdevice' patches. I think these functions should only be added
once they have a user. That's why I wrote the next sentence in the
documents.

Should I handle this differently?

It should be a really simple patch to add these functions and I can
do that if someone needs them or I can just include them in this
patch set.
