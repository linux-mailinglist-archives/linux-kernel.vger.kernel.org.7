It is not one device, it is a collection of devices under one labeled
bus range. Some items here are full normal devices, already modeled by DT
as stand-alone devices, for instance our chipid, efuse, clock controller,
etc. even our pinmux is part of this bus range.

They are grouped as we have one set for each domain (MAIN, WKUP, MCU).

All other splits are not superficial, if we go down that path then
the whole SoC is one "device". We could simply have the whole address
bus be one node and have Linux hard-code offsets in the drivers, we
end up back at board files..

DT should break things into logically distinct and reusable units
so we don't have to store that in the kernel. That is what we do
here, even if some units end up being very small.

They are grouped by function.

The whole block cannot be a system controller as there are regular
devices inside this range. If we made the whole region a syscon and
also left the device nodes inside, then we would have overlapping
register owners, one register would be controlled by two or more
drivers. How would we synchronize mappings, access, updates, etc.
Any one register should belong to exactly one device.

Is your issue the name "system controller", as yes I agree some of
these regions are not "system controllers".

Would it work better if we didn't call this "ti,am62-ddr-pmctrl"
node a "syscon"? That can be done, we just would add a normal
binding doc for it, instead of trying to reuse the generic
bindings/mfd/syscon.yaml file.
