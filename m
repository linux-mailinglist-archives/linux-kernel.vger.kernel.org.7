Hello, Sebastian.

Understood. However, given that these pools are per-cpu, BHs are usually not
heavily contended and canceling itself is a low frequency operation, the
practical difference likely won't be noticeable.

Oh, I'm not insisting, don't know enough to do so. Just trying to understand
the situation.

Okay, so, on !RT, that busy loop section is there to allow
cancel_work_sync() to be called from BH-disabled contexts and the caller is
responsible for ensuring there's no recursion. It's not great but matches
the existing behavior. Obviously, in !RT, we can't go to
wait_for_completion() there because we can be in a non-sleepable context.

Are you saying that, in RT, it'd be fine to call wait_for_completion()
inside local_bh_disable() and won't trip any of the context warnings? If so,
yeah, we don't need any of the looping.

Thanks.
