Jailhouse is quite nice actually. Perhaps you should pick that up
instead, and start refining and improving it? I'd be interested to test
refined jailhouse patches. It's also easy build test images having the
feature both with BuildRoot and Yocto.

It would take me like half'ish day to create build target for it.

OK so neither virtualization nor firmware are well defined here.
Firmware e.g. can mean anything fro pre-bootloader to full operating
system depending on context or who you ask.

It's also pretty hard to project why VMs are bad for cars, and
despite lacking experience with building operating systems for
cars, I'd like to believe that the hardware enforcement that VT-x
and VT-d type of technologies bring is actually great for cars.

It's like every other infosec con where someone is hacking a car,
and I seen even people who've participated to hackatons by car
manufacturers. That industry is improving gradually and the
challenge would be to create hard evidence that this brings
better isolation than VM based solutions..

I'm not sure if specialized hardware means but hardware features
used by e.g., kvm are not in the category of "specialized", unless
you referring specifically to SNP and TDX?
