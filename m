I could be mistaken, but IIRC the RR folk were using sampling mode to
get notifications upon each sample/overflow, but they don't really care
about the sample itself. They might not care about inherited counters
for that workload, but I'm fairly sure that sampling without mmap is a
real (albeit unusual) use-case.

Ok, but presumably they do that mmap() shortly after doing the relavant
perf_event_open() calls?

When do people hit this in practice? Do they actually see this when
deploying a workload, or just when developing code that uses sampling?

Mark.
