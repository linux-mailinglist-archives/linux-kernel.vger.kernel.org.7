If we're talking about theory, a divider of 0 doesn't sound great :)

I'm not sure we should frame the problem as "the core calls clk_recalc",
but rather that it doesn't call round_rate or determine_rate on the new
parent rate, so the clock doesn't have the chance to update its
dividers.

If we were doing the latter, calling clk_recalc after would be ok (even
though a bit redundant).

And calling either will cause other challenges, since they can also
reparent or change the parent rate.

I think I'd still mention that it's a temporary solution because we
can't use them yet.

clk_core already owns a lot of transient data, and I'm not sure adding
more is a good idea.

What if we were to pass the initiating clock to all these functions, and
test if we are indeed this clock instead?
