So the zeroing of the memory seems to be one of the core issues, and as
you know (just re-stating for folks following along) we internally carry
some hacks that allows allocating from these carveouts without the core
dma_alloc_coherent() zeroing the memory out. Those will not go upstream
so skipping the allocations in the first place does seem logical here,
but I'd like to better document what this implies.

For one, any requests for devmem and carveouts in the resource table
will not be handled by Linux and so *must* be already fulfilled by the
external entity that originally booted these rprocs.

Two, since Linux is not providing these memory regions, it doesn't know
they are in use by these rprocs, so we need to be sure to mark them as
no-map or similar, reusable carveout regions will not work here.

Lastly, I've been working on some plans to allow better passing of
buffers to rprocs which currently requires the rproc framework have
knowledge of which rprocs own which regions (for sanity checks,
IOMMU translations, etc..). I'll have to think on how we can still
associate these memories with the rprocs even if they were not
allocated using the below path and don't end up in rproc->mappings.
