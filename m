Thanks for working on this and the changes generally make sense to me.
However, I think we should try a bit harder to reduce friction with the
affected subsystems. It's a bit unfortunate that we're already at rc1. It
would have been better if the new flags and wq were introduced before rc1.
Oh well, we can manage. How about something like this?

- Separate out patches to add the new flag and wq. Don't add the warnings
  yet. I'll commit these patches to a separate wq branch.

- Split out patches by subsystems. I know this is tedious but think it'd
  still be worth doing. It doesn't have to be completely granular. e.g. We
  know that network changes go through a single tree, so all network changes
  can be in a single patch. Each patch can explain the workqueue changes and
  that the patch can be either routed through the subysstem which would
  require pulling from the above wq branch, or, as the default option, we'd
  be happy to route the patch through the workqueue tree. I can create a
  separate branch to collect the conversion patches that can go through wq
  tree.

- After the next rc1 drops, I can apply the patches to add warnings to the
  -fixes branch and then send them to Linus.

This is a bit more work but would likely produce less friction without
delaying the timeline significantly.

Thanks.
