I'm not quite on board with that.

I think we should either we get to the conclusion that the desire of parsing (at
least part of) the firmware ELF is valid in the kernel and make it generic
infrastructure, or conclude that there really isn't a reasonable technical
reason to do that.

Please let's work out the exact technical reasons for doing this in the kernel,
such that we can either conclude one or the other.
