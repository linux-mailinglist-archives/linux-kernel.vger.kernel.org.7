Yes, that's right. I was referring to how streaming allocation worked
before mb_optimize_scan was introduced, when we only had linear traversal.

Because mb_optimize_scan's traversal is unordered, it doesn't encounter
this problem. But linear traversal is still needed when criteria are
CR_GOAL_LEN_SLOW or CR_ANY_FREE, or when s_mb_max_linear_groups is
specified.

Hey Andreas, do you happen to remember what the initial thinking was
behind bringing in the streaming goal (EXT4_MB_STREAM_ALLOC)?

Initially, I tried defining a per-CPU variable where each process would
use the goal corresponding to its current CPU. In CPU-pinned scenarios,
this resulted in almost no interference between CPUs. However, when
writing to the same file sequentially in a non-CPU-pinned environment,
the data blocks could become highly fragmented.

Therefore, I switched to defining a regular array whose length is the
number of CPUs rounded up to the nearest power of 2. By taking the inode
number modulo the array length, we can get the corresponding goal. This
guarantees that the same file consistently uses the same goal. Its
performance is largely similar to inode i_mb_last_group, but it's more
memory-efficient. I'll be switching to this method in the next version.

Thanks again for your suggestion!
