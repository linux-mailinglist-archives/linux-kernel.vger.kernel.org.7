VM_PFNMAP'd memory can't be long term pinned, so users of such memory
ranges will have to adopt mechanisms to get notified. I think it would
be easy to pursue new users of guest_memfd to follow this scheme.
Irrespective of whether VM_PFNMAP'd support lands, guest_memfd
hugepage support already needs the stance of: "Guest memfd owns all
long-term refcounts on private memory" as discussed at LPC [1].

Users will have to signal such failures via the invalidation callback
results or other appropriate mechanisms. guest_memfd can relay the
failures up the call chain to the userspace.

Story will become clearer once VM_PFNMAP'd memory support starts
getting discussed. In case of guest_memfd, there is flexibility to
store metadata for physical ranges within guest_memfd just like
shareability tracking.
