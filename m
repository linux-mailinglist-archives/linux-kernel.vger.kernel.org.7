The CVE was originally filed for Ubuntu Linux ;)
Namely, cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux.

It was moved to kernel.org CNA territory due to some politics,
then it was rejected on the same day the bug was fixed upstream.

Since then, I saw Canonical folks mention that they wanted to
allocate a new one but needed to obfuscate the description so it no
longer sounds like a kernel bug.

Which, incidentally, is not quite true either, it *is* a kernel bug.

Since then I checked, and 5.4 LTS (any<=5.6) had been vulnerable without
the need to ever mount an untrusted/malformed FS just by systematically
corrupting a vanilla fs's B-trees with normal operations.
       

There was also a logic issue I wrote about that hasn't been
patched, since hfs_brec_find() can return with -ENOENT, and
hfsplus_create_attr did not treat ENOENT as a problem when
inserting records, resulting in a flow completely missing the
only boundary checks that were present earlier. With the issue
that commit 25efb2f patched upstream and another issue I found,
the condition for the rejection is no longer true.
The image to begin with is not even corrupt.

According to this, https://lwn.net/Articles/652468/, user namespace
mounting for block filesystems *was seriously considered*
at some point, but it was deemed too hard or costly.
But ok, so it is "doable" in theory.

Then, it is just not consistent with the rest of your CNA practices to
blame users for relaxing requirements on mounting, and as this shows,
this was not even the case here for one of the LTS stables.

I think the delegated threat model is a difficult one, but you kind of
chose this yourselves with the CNA policy of treating most bugs as
potentially exploitable.

No, you (or more like cve@) assign CVEs on panic_on_warn noise instead:)
