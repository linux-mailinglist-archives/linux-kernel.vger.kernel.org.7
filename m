It depends what is meant by "precision".

We can't magic up accuracy that isn't present in the counters, just by
including extra digits when formatting.

So long as we format values in such a way that every counter value is
formatted in a unique way, we are as precise as it is possible to be.

If I didn't confuse myself, ceil(binary_bits * log10(2)) is the
smallest number of fractional decimal digits that provide this
guarantee.


(This may seem pedantic -- partly, I was wondering what was so special
about implementations with fewer than 3 binary places that they needed
special treatment -- I think that still hasn't been answered?)

Loses precision, but does not advertise bogus precision precision
beyond the precision in the original value.  (This is why it is not
standard to print doubles with more then 15 significant digits, even
though 17 significant digits are needed for bit-exact reproduction.)

I don't know whether this matters relative to the use cases, but it
would be nice to have some rationale.

If there is sound rationale for hand-picking some values then yes.

I haven't yet been convinced that there is ;)

(The 7 times table could doubtless be made to look nicer by hand-
picking some entries.  But it wouldn't be the 7 times table any more.)

If userspace can reconstruct the original values, it can do this
calculation more accurately.

Since the values yielded by read1 and read2 might not differ by very
much, the relative error introduced by formatting the values in decimal
_might_ be significant.

(If we include enough decimal digits that there is no error, userspace
will see unexpectedly coarse granularity in the delta read2 - read1.
And this is only practical when the number of fractional bits is small.)


Again, I don't know whether this matters for use cases, but minimising
the number of magic numbers and arbitrary tradeoffs feels like it would
hide fewer potential surprises...

Probably (and in any case, userspace is likely to be a giant hack
rather than rigorous statistical analysis).

Still, telling the userspace the actual precision the hardware supports
feels easy to do.

(It could be added later on as an extension, though.)

It changes the error bars, no?

For 17 bits, ± .00000381 (approx.)
For 19 bits, ± .000000953 (approx.)

(i.e., ± 0.5 times the least-significant bit).

Whether it is important / useful to know this is usecase dependent,
though.

I noticed ;)  In that, there is explicit code here that seems to have
no function other than to make the output worse (i.e., more
unpredictable and with no obvious gain in usefulness).

If the number of digits is the only clue to the size of the error bars
in the readings, userspace code might well care about this.

Exactly.  If knowledge of the error bars is needed, just knowing the
nearest real number to the measured value is insufficient.

But the number of digits is all we seem to be giving userspace to go on
here -- and we're not presenting that in a predictable way, either (?)
