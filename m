Yeah, Jayesh just pointed that out below. I'll add add it to the 
comment.

Yes.

The one set by the chip itself vs the one from the driver, see below.

Yes, I'm using an external clock.

Exactly. But that is racy with what the chip itself is doing. I.e.
if you don't have that usleep() above, the chip will win the race
and the refclk frequency setting will be set according to the
external GPIOs (which is poorly described in the datasheet, btw),
regardless what the linux driver is setting (because that I2C write
happens too early).

Not "rest of the time", the reading of the strapping option from the
GPIO always happens if an external refclk is detected. It's part of
the chip after all. It will just sometimes be overwritten by the
linux driver.

> Is the latter one your usecase?

My use case is that the GPIO setting is wrong on my board (it's really
non-existent) and I'm relying on the linux driver to set the correct
frequency.
