I don't see why *catching* such errors needs pr_err() in core code; without it
you still get a Result as return value that you need to handle in some way.

I guess you mean "bloated with *printing* this individually", rather than
"checking".

This is where we disagree: I think it is "bloating" the core kernel instead if
we start adding error prints to core code, where a proper error code is
propagated up to the driver.

I did say that I would agree to a certain extend with this specific one if we
could print it properly, since it is designed to leave no doubt that returning
an error code from required() is fatal for the driver. But I'm not even sure
about this anymore.

I still haven't read a reason why this one is so crucial to print from core
code, while for other things that are always fatal (e.g. request_irq()) we
don't.

However, if you really think we need a common helper that prints something in
the error case, maybe we can add an *additional* helper

	pub fn required_by(self, dev: &Device) -> Result<T>

and document that it is the same as required(), with an additional error print
in case of failure for the given device.
