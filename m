Well, not really?

It does seem to fetch the general purpose registers. But the code
pretty much assumes we will return to the same location and only stores
them on the stack for the signal handler itself. Also, remember that it
might be userspace or kernel space in your case. The kernel task
registers are in "switch_buf" while the userspace registers are in
"regs" of "struct task_struct" (effectively "struct uml_pt_regs").

Both in a way ;-)

I mean modify the registers in the host mcontext so that the UML
userspace will continue executing inside its signal handler.

I am confused, why would the fault handler be restarted? If you modify
RIP, then the host kernel will not return to the faulting location. You
were using that already to jump into __userspace_relay_signal. All I am
arguing that instead of jumping to __userspace_relay_signal you can
prepare everything and directly jump into the users signal handler.

"stub_signal_interrupt" simply returns, which means it jumps into the
restorer "stub_signal_restorer" which does the rt_sigreturn syscall.
This means the host kernel restores the userspace state from the
mcontext. As the mcontext resides in shared memory, the UML kernel can
update it to specify where the process should continue running (thread
switching, signals, syscall return value, =E2=80=A6).
