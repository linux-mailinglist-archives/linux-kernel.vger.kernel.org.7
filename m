Delayed reponses are certainly better than notification for completion
of agent initiated actions BUT this does not exclude the usage instead
of a sync-command to start the operation and a notification to signal
its completion...depends really on the case.

The classic example of a needed async-cmd is reading a sensor that takes
a long time due to its own physical nature...

AFAIU, in this case you have an async operation whose completion time is
considerably longer (so you aim to configure a specific timeout for that
specific command) BUT it is also bound to the payload itself that you
are trying to load AND/OR to other platform specific HW charactristics
(like how slow are your flashes in this HW releases...): this means that
while the sensor slowness is stable and predictable, and the timeout can
be fixed a-priori, in this case you risk to have in the future anyway to
have to refine and tune this ad-hoc custom timeout....while you'd have
none of this issue by simply waiting for a notification (ofc you could
have to set a large timeout on your side anyway while waiting for
notifs...)

...unless you plan to dynamically tune the async-cmd timeout at runtime
based on the known payload size (that means more commands to query the
soon-to-be-flahsed payload) but anyway this does NOT solve the fact that
the platform characteristics can influence the length of the operation.

Thanks,
Cristian
