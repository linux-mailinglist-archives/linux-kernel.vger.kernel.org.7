Sorry for the delay. I was at a conference last week.
Thank you for sending these logs.

This is clear from the suspend hook in the vhci_hcd.
When it returns EBUSY, suspend will fail and move to
auto resume.

> dmesg-faux bus-device bound-auto resume.log

It is good that the behavior is same with faux bus even though
suspend hook isn't called. I will take a look at the log.

That is bad. When does this happen? Is there a difference in
configuration?

The behavior same for platform bus and faux bus. Sounds like
an existing problem that needs to be debugged separately.

I will take a look at all these logs and get back to you in
a day or two.
