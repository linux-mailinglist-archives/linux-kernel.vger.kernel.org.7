I'm not sure about this. Our encoders are implemented by the DPU
driver, so I'd rather not call MST functions from it.
You might call it from drm_bridge_funcs::atomic_check(), it is being
called at the same stage.

These two are fine. Please move them to proper places.

This is fine. We should drop state-related data from
msm_dp_mst_bridge, the msm_dp_mst_bridge_state can stay.
I wanted to get rid of unnecessary slots management in the MSM DP
driver, the state is fine to exist.

Can't we keep msm_dp_panel in the connector's state and access it by
getting the state by the connector?

Then please eliminate a way for the system to enter an 'inconsistent
error state'.
