To speed up the process a little as the 6.15-rcX window shrinks (and
it appears Abel may be OOO?), I run a series of tests to attempt to
answer your questions. In short - PS8830 is a very quirky device, and
you were right that the current implementation could've simply set
transparent mode.

To clarify the test matrix: PS8830 was tested with Dell XPS 9345.
PS8833 was tested with Asus Zenbook A14. Unfortunately, my dock (Dell
WD19TB) is a universal Thunderbolt/DP-Alt mode dock, and only works if
it's forced to DP alt mode, since PCIE tunneling is not yet supported
on qcom. Dell allows to disable thunderbolt/PCIE tunneling support in
BIOS, hence forcing the dock to be Type-C/DP-alt mode (and show up
with LTTPR onboard). No such feature exists on Asus, so I could not
test PS8833 with the docking station at all.

Complete test matrix;

1. Do nothing/pre Abel's series (LTTPRs assumed to be in transparent
mode unless firmware pre-configured them):
PS8833:
- Type-C to HDMI: works almost always
- Type-C to DP: never works, EDID read fails

PS8830:
- Type-C to HDMI: never works, CR LT fails (-22)
- Type-C to DP: never works, EDID read fails
- Type-C to dock: never works, EQ LT fails (-110)

2. Explicitly set LTTPRs to transparent mode (early exit LTTPR helper
introduced by Abel, after setting transparent mode, but before setting
non-transparent mode):
PS8833:
- Type-C to HDMI: works. Occasionally fails to get DP sink modes (may
be unrelated)
- Type-C to DP: works**

PS8830:
- Type-C to HDMI: works
- Type-C to DP: works**
- Type-C to dock: Sometimes all works. Sometimes video works, but USB
(2.0 nor 3.0) is not working. Sometimes EQ LT fails (-110) and nothing
works. Overall extremely unstable.

3. Explicitly set LTTPRs to non-transparent mode (aka Abel's series):
PS8833:
- Type-C to HDMI: never works, CR LT fails, max v_level reached (-11)
- Type-C to DP: never works, CR LT fails, max v_level reached (-11)

PS8830:
- Type-C to HDMI: works
- Type-C to DP: works**
- Type-C to dock: never works, CR LT fails (-110)

4. Explicitly set LTTPRs to non-transparent mode, support per-segment
training (aka Abel's initial LTTPR support series + this series):
PS8833:
- Type-C to HDMI: works
- Type-C to DP: works

PS8830:
- Type-C to HDMI: works
- Type-C to DP: works
- Type-C to dock: works


** At first, Type-C to DP was frequently/always depending on the use
case failing to read panel EDID, just like in the 1st test case. As I
am 100% certain it worked in the past, did a few more tests. It
appears that in an earlier version of Abel's patch (<=3Dv4), DPRX caps
were read _after_ LTTPR init, just like DP standard mandates (don't
have exact quote, something along the lines 'source shall re-read sink
caps after LTTPR init'). In v4 there was a suggestion [1] (from you
actually :)) to first try to read DPRX caps, then init LTTPRs in order
to fail early if caps readout fails. Reverting this change fixes EDID
read error. Since I was running Abel's series long before it landed, I
never used the broken v5. With the order of functions reverted, Type-C
to DP started working/failing in the same way Type-C to HDMI dongle
did, just as expected. Wrt to the issue itself, the first patch of
this very series actually both fixes this issue by conforming to DP
spec, and also takes into account your suggestion in Abel's v4 series
to be able to fail early in case of DPRX caps readout failure.

To summarize the findings:
- PS8830 is a very quirky device. It does not work in
default/transparent mode unless explicitly set. It does work in
non-transparent mode without per-segment training, even though it
should've not. As per last email, it is lying about not supporting
training level 3.
- PS8833 seems to be a fixed version of PS8830. It does work in
default/transparent mode oob. It does not work in non-transparent mode
without per-segment training, just as expected. As per last email, it
correctly reports training level 3 capability.

To answer some of your questions (from a 3rd party view, cannot speak
for the authors):
- "So I am surprised how Xelite worked without this." - From tests
above: PS8830 worked when it should've not, seems because it's quirky.
PS8833 did not work, which makes sense.
- Doubts about non-transparent mode requirement for X1E/X1P systems -
From tests above: seems you are right. I don't know why it was forced
to be non-transparent without per-segment training, instead of simply
transparent. Though, seeing how weird the PS8830 is, I wouldn't be
surprised if it behaves differently in other laptops... just
speculating though.
 - "Was enabling non-transparent mode more of a requirement of the
parade retimer chip in Xelite?" - cannot fully answer. Initializing
LTTPRs as such appears to be a requirement of the Parade PS8830 (not
PS8833, which wasn't around back then afaik), as it just wouldn't work
oob. Choice of non-transparent instead of transparent mode is not very
clear to me.

Even though it appears initial LTTPR support could've been done
slightly differently, combination of those initial patches + this
series seem to provide both the best practical results, as well as
most (well, almost, excluding LTTPR's train level verification)
accurate LTTPR implementation, while also making msm-dp similar/up to
date with Intel/AMD's LTTPR implementation. Also learned something new
today myself, don't buy PS8830 :)

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Alex
