The data returned by open() can be anything. It can also be some arbitrary
Arc<T> that already exists and is looked up in open(). It can also be something
new that is created within open() and requires in-place initialization.

So, if we want to change this, we could return an `impl PinInit<Self, Error>` as
you suggest above and initialize it in-place in
`RawDeviceRegistration::private`.

I agree that this is the correct thing to do, but that really sounds like a
subsequent patch.
