Perhaps "completely detached" is just a synonym for the common assumption=
=20
that there can be only one and abuse of statics, which are generally=20
frowned upon but also commonly used in platform drivers regardless. So=20
there are these caveats in that supposed complete detatchedness.

But yeah, in some case it makes things easier.
