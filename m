Again continuing this thread from March 2022:

This problem has never been fixed; it is still present in 6.16-rc3.  To
recap: core dumps from a program using io_uring get truncated,
especially if the core is piped to a program.  I have a forward-port of
Jen's patch that fixes it, but apparently that patch did not pass muster
with Linus back in 2021.  Any chance of getting this fixed properly
upstream?
