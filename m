You're right to ask for clarification. The `<swap_device_id>` refers
to a unique identifier added to each swap device entry in `/proc/swaps`.
I will revise the documentation to make this clearer.

As a side note, I initially had concerns about breaking the existing ABI.
However, the additional ID column does not significantly change the
current output format and is gated behind `CONFIG_SWAP_CGROUP_PRIORITY`,
so it should be safe and intuitive to expose it through `/proc/swaps

That's a valid observation. While `memory.swap.max=0` controls the overall
swap usage limit, the `default disabled` entry is intended to disable
specific swap devices within the scope of this cgroup interface. The
motivation was to offer more granular control over device selection
rather than total swap usage.

Thank you for pointing this out. My original philosophy was to preserve
as much of the existing swap functionality as possible, including
NUMA-aware behaviors.

However, I agree that the explanation is complex and also not be
necessary for my proposed usage. After some reflection, I believe the
implementation (and documentation) will be clearer and simpler without
supporting negative priorities here. 

Unless further objections arise, I plan to drop this behavior in the next
version of the patch, as you suggested. If compelling use cases emerge in
the future, we can consider reintroducing the support at that time.

Thanks again for your helpful review!

Best regards,
Youngjun Park
