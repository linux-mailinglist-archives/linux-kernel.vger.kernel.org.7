It's never been suggested that drivers should do that; indeed trying to 
poke into and second-guess the DMA API implementation is generally even 
less OK than making blind assumptions about what it might do. The 
overall message here is essentially "if you want to do streaming DMA 
then you may need to be wary of where your memory comes from." We can't 
just throw that out and say "Yeah it's fine now, whatever you do the API 
will deal with it" because that simply isn't true as a general 
statement; drivers dealing with limited DMA masks *do* still need to be 
concerned with GFP_DMA (or even GFP_DMA32 might still be advisable in 
certain cases) if they want to have an appreciable chance of success. 
All that's different these days is that notion of "limited" generally 
meaning "32 bits or smaller".

Indeed that might actually end up pushing things in the opposite 
direction, at least in some cases. Right now, a driver with, say, a 
40-bit DMA mask is usually better off not special-casing DMA buffers, 
and just making plain GFP_KERNEL allocations for everything (on the 
assumption that 64-bit systems with masses of memory *should* have 
SWIOTLB to cover things in the worst case), vs. artificially 
constraining its DMA buffers to GFP_DMA32 and having to deal with 
allocation failure more often. However with a more precise and flexible 
allocator, there's then a much stronger incentive for such drivers to 
explicitly mark *every* allocation that may be used for DMA, in order to 
get the optimal behaviour.

Thanks,
Robin.
