Yes, display PLL is flexible and device manager should set exact 
frequency. Please note that there was a bug in device manager in earlier 
releases which would prevent setting it to exact clocks. You should try 
with latest SDK release firmware binaries (11.0...(10.1 should also work 
though)) if seeing any misbehaviour in that regard.

This is correct. The pixel clock is derived as OLDI clock/7 when OLDI is 
enabled.

I think what you described is correct, if any specific questions I can 
help check. But any misbehaviour you are seeing w.r.t clock setting 
(i.e. what driver is trying to set versus what actually is getting set)
then please dump the dss clock tree along with relevant details of test 
done:

k3conf dump clock <display_device_id>

You can get the device ID via TISCI Doc [1]
