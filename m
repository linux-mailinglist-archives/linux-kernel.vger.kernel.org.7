There are some comments in the hugetlb faulting path that are not
holding anymore because the code has changed.
Most promiment is this one:

 /*
  * vmf.orig_pte could be a migration/hwpoison vmf.orig_pte at this
  * point, so this check prevents the kernel from going below assuming
  * that we have an active hugepage in pagecache. This goto expects
  * the 2nd page fault, and is_hugetlb_entry_(migration|hwpoisoned)
  * check will properly handle it.
  */

This was written because back in the day we used to do:

 hugetlb_fault
  ptep = huge_pte_offset(...)
  if (ptep) {
    entry = huge_ptep_get(ptep)
    if (unlikely(is_hugetlb_entry_migration(entry))
        ...
    else if (unlikely(is_hugetlb_entry_hwpoisoned(entry)))
        ...

  ...
  ...

 /*
  * entry could be a migration/hwpoison entry at this point, so this
  * check prevents the kernel from going below assuming that we have
  * a active hugepage in pagecache. This goto expects the 2nd page fault,
  * and is_hugetlb_entry_(migration|hwpoisoned) check will properly
  * handle it.
  */
 if (!pte_present(entry))
         goto out_mutex;
 ...

The code was designed to check for hwpoisoned/migration entries upfront,
and then bail out if further down the pte was not present anymore,
relying on taking the second fault so the code from the beginning would
handle it this time for real.

This has changed, so this comment does not hold.
Also, mention in hugetlb_fault() that besides allocation and instantiation,
the mutex also serializes against truncation.
