I missed one important point while replying. This channel has an existing
interface between the host and endpoint i.e., the MHI based WLAN and modems out
there in the field already support an *interface* on top of this channel. We
cannot control the interface unless we change the endpoint firmware (which is
not feasible). And all the future extensions could only be possible if we could
modify the endpoint fw.

So for this specific reason, going by the sysfs ABI made sense to me. But to
admit, this point was never mentioned in the cover letter or in the patch
description and need to be fixed.

I also asked the Qcom PCIe team to verify that this interface, just works with
all kind of MHI devices if the devices support the LOOPBACK channel.

I don't want to omit the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() since that will require users to
load the driver manually to use it. If users do not want this interface, then
they can always decide not to enable the driver while building the kernel :)
