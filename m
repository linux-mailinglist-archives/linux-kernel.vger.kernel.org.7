Great!

Yes, userspace is the thing that does this when it is told to do it by
the kernel.

Look at how all firmware is loaded on your system today, this isn't a
new thing, it's been working well for everyone for decades now :)

Again, look at how your firmware for your devices in your laptop are
loaded today.
