I think we need to know more about your system. Why does cate exist?
Why are you mixing different functions onto one channel, rather than
having a channel per function?

I think you should remove cate from the GPIO protocol.

What does not answer my question: What should happen if an invalid
value is passed?

You must have major:minor for a reason. You expect to change
them. Then what happens? How should forward/backwards compatibility
work? Must version 0:0 always be implemented, were as 0:1 is optional?
How do you find out if 0:1 is implemented?

You need to specify this in the protocol. Looking at the messages, i
don't see why i could not send off a batch of requests with different
line values, and later expect a batch of replies with different line
values. The linux driver can then match the replies to the request and
know they are all answered. The current specification allows that.

You really need to forget about your implementation. Look at the
specification, and think about all the different ways it can be
implemented, and conform to the specification. If there is only one
possible implementation, your specification is good. If it can be
implemented in multiple ways, you need to improve the specification.

We don't care about other functions. This is all about GPIO.

That implies that you cannot look at major:minor and know if the
reserved bits are reserved, or have some actual meaning?

Again, think about forward/backwards compatibility. How do you turn a
reserved bit into a used bit? Is the specification sufficient to make
that possible.

Keep going.....

Does that imply if none of the lines have wakeup enabled, the GPIO
controller can be suspended when Linux suspends? How does the GPIO
controller know it can suspend? There is no message for that. How does
it know to come out of suspension?

At sounds broken.

A level interrupt is not cleared until the level changes. The typical
flow is:

Interrupt fires.

Interrupt is masked

Interrupt handler is called, which reads/write registers in the device
who pin is connected to the GPIO

Interrupt is unmasked



At the unmask point, the interrupt will fire again, if the level is
still in the active state. You need this because while reading/writing
registers in the device, another event can happen, which needs
handling. Generally, the interrupt output of a device is an OR of many
different sources. You only release the interrupt when all sources
have been cleared.

So for the protocol, you need to acknowledge the notification after
the interrupt handler has executed. And that could cause another
notification to be immediately sent if the line is still active.

I'm not too sure how edge interrupts should work. If we are still busy
in an edge interrupt handler, do we want to know about the next edge?
Should edge interrupts be disabled until the previous edge has been
handled? I'm not too familiar with edge interrupts, most of the device
i've handled are level.
