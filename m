The purpose of File<T> is that with an instance of File<T> you can access the T.
This is totally normal. You give the file ownership of some T and you still want
to be able to access this T the File instance has ownership of.

It's not load-bearing at all in builds that have debugfs disabled; there is
zero overhead. When compiled without debugfs File<T>'s only member is the data
itself. In fact, it's even slighly less, since the T can be a KBox<U> rather
than an Arc<U>.

Sorry, but that really looks like a bad workaround. Now I have an additional
allocation and a reference counted FirmwareInfo instance for no reason, other
than debugfs imposing a bad API on users. :(

In more complicated cases, this could be lots of additional allocations and
reference counted structures just because of debugfs.

This is already the case with this version on the mailing list. You're passing
*ForeignOwnable* data to the File, which the File instance subsequently owns.

There is zero difference in ownership, the difference is that File<T> allows you
to access the data it owns, whereas just File does not, which makes it necessary
to use an Arc.

That's what I proposed the pin-init solution below for.

So, you're arguing that changing

	struct Foo {
	   bar: Bar,
	}

to

	struct Foo {
	   bar: Arc<Bar>,
	   bar_file: debugfs::File,
	}

is better than

	struct Foo {
	   bar: debugfs::File<Bar>,
	}

correct? If so, I really have to disagree.

Why would you even compare two File instances? If your T implements PartialEq,
and you want to compare it with some other T just use the
ForeignOwnable::Borrowed you get from dereferencing the File.

Seems like a pretty minor concern, but if you want you can still do the Arc
dance in your driver, no?

This is only half the truth, since this is *only* the case if you don't need to
access the data you move into the File, since otherwise you have to keep an Arc
around.

Indeed, that was a bad example, let's say Vec<u8> then. :)

Stuffing single File instances into a Vec seems like the wrong thing to do.

Instead you may have instances of some data structure that is created
dynamically in your driver that you want to expose through debugfs.

Let's say you have (userspace) clients that can be registered arbitrarily, then
you want a Vec<Client>, which contains the client instances. In order to provide
information about the Client in debugfs you then have the client embed things as
discussed above.

	struct Client {
	   id: File<ClientId>,
	   data: File<ClientData>,
	   ...
	}

I think that makes much more sense than keeping a Vec<Arc<Client>> *and* a
Vec<File> separately. Also, note that with the above, your Client instances
don't need to be reference counted anymore.

I think this addresses the concerns below.
