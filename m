Hi Arnaud, 
Thanks for review.

It's more like an improvement.

AFAIC, annoymous inode is a common interface and used extensivly in kernel development.
Some examples below.

Yep, performance is one of motivations of this change.

Yes. You have to open /dev/rpmsgX which is generated by legacy ioctl to
instantiate a new endpoint.

Hardly, because client still can't access /dev/rpmsgX which is generated
by host _after_ client is launched.

Fd is the abstraction of an unique endpoint device, it holds true for
both legacy and new approach.

So I guess what you mean is that /dev/rpmsgX is global to all so other process
can access it?

But /dev/rpmsgX is designed to be opened only once, it's implemented as
singleton pattern.

static int rpmsg_eptdev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)
{
...
        if (eptdev->ept) {
                mutex_unlock(&eptdev->ept_lock);
                return -EBUSY;
        }
...
        eptdev->ept = ept;
...
}

No, it's just a silly benchmark demo, large sample reduces noise statistically.

Sorry to hear that. But no, it's a pretty normal skill in kernel codebase
, I had to copy some examples from reply to other reviewer[1].

anon_inode_get_{fd,file} are used extensively in kernel for returning a new
fd to userspace which is associated with an unique data structure in kernel
space, in different ways:

- via ioctl(), some examples are:

 - KVM ioctl(s)
   - KVM_CREATE_VCPU -> kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu
   - KVM_GET_STATS_FD -> kvm_vcpu_ioctl_get_stats_fd
   - KVM_CREATE_DEVICE -> kvm_ioctl_create_device
   - KVM_CREATE_VM -> kvm_dev_ioctl_create_vm

 - DMA buf/fence/sync ioctls
   - DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE -> dma_buf_export_sync_file
   - SW_SYNC_IOC_CREATE_FENCE -> sw_sync_ioctl_create_fence
   - Couples of driver implement DMA buf by using anon file _implicitly_:
     - UDMABUF_CREATE -> udmabuf_ioctl_create
     - DMA_HEAP_IOCTL_ALLOC -> dma_heap_ioctl_allocate

 - gpiolib ioctls:
   - GPIO_GET_LINEHANDLE_IOCTL -> linehandle_create
   - GPIO_V2_GET_LINE_IOCTL

 -  IOMMUFD ioctls:

 -  VFIO Ioctls:

 - ....


- via other specific syscalls:
 - epoll_create1
 - bpf
 - perf_event_open
 - inotify_init
 - ...
