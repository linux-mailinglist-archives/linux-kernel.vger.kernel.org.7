On my side I've implemented the devlink-based approach, and I have to say i'm not
so unhappy with it :) At least I don't have the feeling this is bending
the API to fit one specific case.

The thing is that the qualifier model doesn't fully map to the situation we
have in stmmac.

The stmmac coarse/fine adjustment doesn't only changes the timestamping
behaviour, but also the ptp_clock adjustment mode. 

So changing the qualifier here will have a side effect on the PTP clock,
do we accept that as part of the hwprov timestamping API ?

Should we use this API for coarse/fine stmmac config, I agree with your
previous comment of adding a dedicated qualifier that explicitely says
that using this qualifier comes with side effects, with the risk of
paving the way for lots of modes being added for driver-specific scenarios.

Another thing with the stmmac implem is that we don't truly have 2
timestampers (1 approx and 1 precise), but rather only one whose precision
can be adjusted. Does it really make sense here to have the qualifier
writeable for the same timestamper ?

Of course the netlink tsinfo/tsconfig is more appealing due to its generic
nature, but OTHO I don't want to introduce ill-defined behaviours in that
API with this series. The multiple timestamper work still makes a ton of
sense for MAC+PHY timestamping setups :)

I'm opened for both approached TBH :)

Maxime
