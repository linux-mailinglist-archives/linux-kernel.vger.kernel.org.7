With the design I explained below, this becomes not necessary. Less
unsafe code always is better, since there are fewer places that can go
wrong.

Also hiding all the unsafe code inside of your module as private code or
implementation detail is also much better, as you prevent people from
accidentally using it.

That's true, but why not make the trait take references if all users
will use references anyways :)

Yeah it's probably fine.

Big macro bodies are rarely the issue. Lots of parsing in declarative
macros is where they become unreadable.

Sure, but if we can make it safe, we should. I could also very much
imagine that someone has a statically allocated buffer they would want
to write stuff to and this function would then allow that with much
easier `unsafe` code than the current approach.
