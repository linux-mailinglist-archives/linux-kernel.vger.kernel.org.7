Wonderful. KHO use kho_preserve_folio() to mark a folio to be preserved.
After kexec, it use kho_restore_folio/page() to restore a folio.
There is also kho_preserve_phys(), you should only use it for memory
that does not have a page struct, e.g. CMA.

You can take a look at the current version of luo and replace the libFDT
usage with KSTATE, that would be a good starting point.

That is good to know.
We need to have something like fdt debugfs node for kstate.

Need to have the domain number with PCI_DEVID as well.

I am expect to call some thing like kstate_save() in the LUO prepare call b=
ack.
LUO has a few stage. "Prepare" is where you save most of the stuff and
VM is still running.
"Reboot" is where VM is already paused. The last chance to save any
thing before kexec.

It needs to happen before that, in pci_setup_device() it already need
to know if the device is keepalive or not. If device is keep alive,
the PCI core will need to re-create the device state from an already
running device rather than initialize the device fresh. It needs to
avoid perform PCI config space write to keepalive PCI devices.

Yes we can start simple. Right now the KSTATE only follow pointer in
the Kernel C struct rather than the saved state objects. We will need
to support pointer following in the saved state object as well. That
is some thing very different from typical message serialization. In
the kernel it is easier to spread the state buffer in to recursive C
struct that store in different pages. The kstate stream will be more
or less like a tree of objects.

 ID.

In my mind, the ID is a number, it is unique to a struct type. Once
the number is assign to member field, it will not able to reuse that
number for other field in that struct, it will stay with that field
member for live. If the field get deleted, that number will still not
be able to re-use by other member in that struct. Each field will also
have a string name for debug purpose.

Different struct can have same ID number, but it will have different
meaning. Just like (struct a*)->foo have different meaning than
(struct b*)->foo, it is on different name space.

If the vendor want to make sure never conflict with upstream, they
should allocate the ID in a vendor specific struct. That way it will
make sure the vendor get their own struct name space. The struct has a
texted name so it will not conflict with vendors. The field ID will
remain as number.

Let me clarify. I don't mean to save the V2.1 kstate_description as it
is. The current kstate_description have type system and a run time
portion as well. The run time portion does not save. Only the type
system and possible value description. (min, max, enum etc).
> e.g. if I want to rearrange some ->flags for whatever reason.
If possible, would be best not save those flags. However, if the flag
is used to describe how the wire format object is layouted, those will
have to be save and part of the ABI as well. There is no way to get
around that even without saving the descriptor table.

> So how to deal with changes in kstate_description itself?
The member in the kstate_description itself will have a description
table to describe it as well. The will be a minimal set of
kstate_description feature to describe other capabilities.
The kstate_descrition can have a capability array (inspired by the PCI
capabilities) declare what it supports.

For example, the basic version only support two buffer container type.
1) pointer with size. 2) <array counter n> + linear array layout in
memory of n elements.
The new kernel add a container type 3) single link list ptr pointer
array. It points to page contain {<next list page pfn> + <array
counter n> + 510<page pfn array>}. The ptr list array can describe a
kvmalloc buffer without recursive allocate page pointer array . The
new kernel can detect the old kernel does not have this capability.
When roll back to old kernel.  It do not use ptr link list array to
write out saved state object.

The description table will have a version number as well as last
defense If we have to introduce change that break the description
table compatibility. We can bump that version. That is the only place
need to have a version number. Other capability should always describe
using capability feature set.

Those I consider as run time behavior. I hope we don't need to save
the function pointers.
