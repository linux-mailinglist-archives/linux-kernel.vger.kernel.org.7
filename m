Thanks for the clarification.

Just to confirm — the current version of the driver is customized to allow
user space to directly manipulate LP5812 registers and to support the
device’s full feature set. Because of this, it doesn’t follow the standard
LED interfaces.

Given that, would it be acceptable to submit this driver under the misc subsystem instead?
