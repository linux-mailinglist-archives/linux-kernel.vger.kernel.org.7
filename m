I'd agree with not adding unit number to the simple-bus

I went ahead and checked those comments, and found them all about 
devices under specific bus, I'm not strongly against adding the
comments but feel it's kind of unnecessary, or even in worst cases,
it may bring extra confusions.. on the other hand, you can always
check  device nodes under the bus to find what's there.

exmaple for dram4_range(vendor code)/dma_bus, the comments is
 /* DMA controller, and users */
what's is 'users'? still have to check the dts, and find them -
uart, spi, i2c, qspi, hdmi, sounds..

If people really want to add comments and help others to understand
this patch, then I'd suggest to add explanation in commit message(better?)
to fully describe all the busses, or why choose this name? -
 storage/multimedia/pcie/camera/dma/network_bus
pretty much in much high level perspective..

I think those all above already exist in Guodong's version which
align his idea

It would be great if DT maintainer can clarify, or give an ACK

Instead, from a SoC tree maintainer's perspective (whom taking care of
merging all the dts files), I'd rather perfer an independent or
separated patch for this given every party reached consesus, so we could
get this patch merged first and early, instead of getting them distributed all
over in different series, IMO, separated patches brings more dedependencies
if more than two series require one bus and result in more merge conflicts..
Besides, introducing new busses result in re-arrangement of previous nodes,
those like uart, i2c (even they have no DMA feature implemented currently)..
