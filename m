I would interpret the always, madvise, and never options as follows:
- always
  The sysadmin strongly recommends using THP. If a user does not
want to use it, they must explicitly disable it.
- madvise
 The sysadmin gently encourages the use of THP, but it is only
enabled when explicitly requested by the application.
- never
  The sysadmin discourages the use of THP, and "its use is only permitted
with explicit approval" .

It appears so=E2=80=94thank you for the clarification.
