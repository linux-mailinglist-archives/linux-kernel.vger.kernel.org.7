Yes, I believe this could be the best approach.
I have compared several possible approaches before making this proposal. These
are the alternatives I reviewed in the RFC:
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20250612103743.3385842-1-youngjun.park@lge.com/)
The part I mentions are as belows

In my view, the `swap.tier` proposal aligns quite well with alternative (3) that
I reviewed. That approach keeps the global priority assignment while adding
inclusion/exclusion semantics at the cgroup level. The reason I decided not to
go with it is because it lacks flexibility — it cannot express arbitrary
ordering. As noted above, it is impossible to represent arbitrary orderings,
which is why I chose a per-device priority strategy instead.

Since you seem most concerned about complexity, I have been thinking more about
this point.

1. **Conceptual complexity**  
   The idea is simply to add a swap priority list per cgroup. This is
   straightforward to understand. The more complicated part is NUMA priority
   handling — but if that turns out to be too complex, we can drop it entirely
   or adjust its semantics to reduce the complexity.

2. **Implementation complexity**  
   Could you clarify from which perspective you see implementation complexity as
   problematic? I would like to know more specifically what part worries you.

The `swap.tier` concept also requires mapping priorities to tiers, creating
per-cgroup tier objects, and so forth. That means a number of supporting
structures are needed as well. While I agree it is conceptually well-defined,
I don’t necessarily find it simpler than the per-device priority model.

Could you elaborate on what exactly you mean by “inverting swap entry LRU order”?
Do you mean that because of per-cgroup priority differences, entries on the
global swap LRU list could become inconsistent when viewed from different
cgroups? If that is the case, could you explain more concretely what problems
such inconsistencies would cause? That would help me understand the concern
better.

I see, thank you for the suggestion. I also think having the chance to discuss
this at LPC would be very beneficial for me. I will not see it as a burden —
if I decide to go forward, I will let you know right away (until this week).

Could you explain in more detail why the flush operation is difficult in that
case? I would like to understand what the concrete difficulty is.

This is related to the same question above — I would appreciate a more
detailed explanation because it is not yet clear to me. Why is it easy?

I mentioned already on this mail: what swap tiers cannot do is arbitrary
ordering. If ordering is fixed globally by tiers, some workloads that want to
consume slower swap devices first (and reserve faster devices as a safety
backend to minimize swap failures) cannot be expressed. This kind of policy
requires arbitrary ordering flexibility, which is possible with per-device
priorities but not with fixed tiers.

And vswap possible usage: if we must consider vswap (assume we can select it
like an individual swap device), where should it be mapped in the tier model?
(see https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/CAMgjq7BA_2-5iCvS-vp9ZEoG=1DwHWYuVZOuH8DWH9wzdoC00g@mail.gmail.com/) 
In my opinion, it cannot be mapped purely by service speed. 
There are indeed situations where tiering by service speed is beneficial, 
but I also believe priority-based ordering can capture the same intention 
while also covering exceptional use cases.

So, I see the per-device priority approach as more general: it can represent
tier-based usage, but also more flexible policies that tiers alone cannot cover.

I think that any new concept adds complexity, whether it is “swap.tier” or
per-device priority. If you could clarify more precisely what kind of
complexity you are most concerned about, I would be happy to give my detailed
thoughts in that direction.

Thank you again for your prompt and thoughtful feedback :). I will continue
thinking about this further while awaiting your reply.

Best regards,
Youngjun Park
