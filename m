The prerequisite patch series to the Intel Telemetry code is
now in the Linux x86 platform drivers tree:
Link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pdx86/platform-drivers-x86.git/
queued for the v6.17 merge window.

That series is based on v6.16-rc1. One resctrl bugfix went into
Linus' tree after -rcl: commit 594902c986e2 ("x86,fs/resctrl: Remove
inappropriate references to cacheinfo in the resctrl subsystem")

These patches are based on the x86 platform drivers tree plus cherry
pick of that patch. For convenience I've pushed that base, and this
series to the rdt-aet-v7-base and rdt-aet-v7 branches of:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aegl/linux.git

Changes since v6 was posted here:

Change "frac += 1 << (binary_bits - 1);" to "frac += 1ull << (binary_bits - 1);"
s/sprintf/snprintf/ to fill the buf[] with the fractional part of value.
If architecture did not supply a binary_bits value for an event that
filesystem designated as floating point, print as "val.0" for consistent
user interface.


--- 15 ---
No comments. Unchanged.

--- 16 ---
Replace commit comment with Reinette version.

--- 17 ---
Commit comment:
	s/published in the/published in/
	s/The XML files provide/The XML file provides/
Added paragraph tying "aggregators" to "regions":
  Each aggregator makes event counters available to Linux in
  a region of MMIO memory. Enumeration of these regions is
  done by the INTEL_PMT_DISCOVERY discovery driver.

Change name of configure_events() to discover_events()

Introduce a new Kconfig option X86_RESCTRL_CPU_INTEL_AET that is
only visible when INTEL_PMT_DISCOVERY=y so that x86 resctrl can
be configured without forcing inclusion of an Intel specific
driver.

--- 18 ---
Change MMIO size check to require equality with expected value.
s/Configure events/Discover events/ to match new function name
Update comment "Count how many per package" to say what is being
counted ("usable telemetry regions").
s/telemetry_regions/telemetry regions/ in comment.

Split known event group array into energy and perf lists.
Build a list of the enabled event groups.

--- 19 ---
Fix second paragraph to avoid redundancy. s/mmio/MMIO/
Clarify in ascii art that the first level structures refer
to package ID 0, package ID 1.

Rename struct mmio_info to struct pkg_mmio_info and
free_mmio_info() free_pkg_mmio_info() to match.

Change type of pkg_mmio_info::num_regions to unsigned int.

Update step 2 in header comment for discover_events().

Drop the test for duplicate telemetry information for a guid.
It can't happen because get_pmt_feature() stops scanning as
soon as discover_events() succeeds.

--- 20 ---
Change subject to say adding events for two specific GUIDs.

Added note that these two GUIDs are the ones used by Clearwater
Forest.

Changed the commit comment on MMIO counter layout to use
the "energy" guid=0x26696143 case as a specific example.

Changed type of pmt_event::idx and pmt_event::bin_bits to unsigned int
Ditto for event_group::num_events.

--- 21 ---
Add more detail for kerneldoc for resctrl_arch_rmid_read() arch_priv argument.

Provide the QOS_L3_OCCUP_EVENT_ID arch_priv value to resctrl_arch_rmid_read()
in the call from __check_limbo().

--- 22 ---
Drop confusing "core" from Subject.

--- 23 ---
Drop stale part of commit message about changing functions to
add/remove domains and bring them online or take them offline.
Those changes were incorporated into earlier patches in the
series.


--- 24 ---
Drop the "software_" part from rdt_is_software_feature_enabled().
Update comments to refer to hardware features instead of software
features. Expand "h/w" to "hardware. Drop use of "s/w".
Drop a stray "*" that appeared when reformatting block comment.


--- 25 ---
"as any time" -> "at any time"
drop "to ensure that all resctrl groups ..."
Fix rdt_num_rmids_show() to print r->num_rmid with "%u"

Dropped the rdt_is_software_feature_force_enabled() function.
Added a new rdt_set_feature_disabled().

Code flow now matches more closely that for the X86_FEATURE
enable/disable.
	1) Check at the start of discover_events() to see if there
	   are sufficient RMIDs. If there are not, then use
	   rdt_set_feature_disabled() to mark the feature disabled.
	2) Then call rdt_is_feature_enabled() which will override
	   the decision if the user specified rdt={feature} on the
	   kernel commend line.


--- 26 ---
Split into two:
Part 0027 cleans up the life cycle of closid_num_dirty_rmids and renames
some functions to add "_l3" components to their names.

Part 0028 Moves scan of resources and allocation of RMIDs to mount time
and renames dom_data_{init,exit{(). Dropped the "once" check from
rdt_get_tree()


--- 27 ---
No comments. Moved the "{name} monitoring detected" message to discover_events()


--- 28 ---
Fixed comment comment to match function name and path name with code.

Added a note that the {arch} component is "uname -m".

Added usage guidance in comment comment and block comment for
resctrl_debugfs_mon_info_arch_mkdir().

Added kerneldoc on life cycle (removed by resctrl_exit()) and
return value.

Clear debugfs_resctrl_info in resctrl_exit()

--- 29 ---
Fix Subject to refer to debugfs instead of info/ directory

s/arch/x86_64/ in pathname description

Use DEFINE_SIMPLE_ATTRIBUTE() to define file ops.

Exit create_debugfs_status_file early if debugfs directory cannot be created


--- 30 ---
Update details about core_energy and activity events to explain
they measure only "core" amounts.

Remove section about new status file uner info directory.

Add section about debugfs use.


Background
----------
On Intel systems that support per-RMID telemetry monitoring each logical
processor keeps a local count for various events. When the IA32_PQR_ASSOC.RMID
value for the logical processor changes (or when a two millisecond counter
expires) these event counts are transmitted to an event aggregator on
the same package as the processor together with the current RMID value. The
event counters are reset to zero to begin counting again.

Each aggregator takes the incoming event counts and adds them to
cumulative counts for each event for each RMID. Note that there can be
multiple aggregators on each package with no architectural association
between logical processors and an aggregator.

All of these aggregated counters can be read by an operating system from
the MMIO space of the Out Of Band Management Service Module (OOBMSM)
device(s) on a system. Any counter can be read from any logical processor.

Intel publishes details for each processor generation showing which
events are counted by each logical processor and the offsets for each
accumulated counter value within the MMIO space in XML files here:
https://github.com/intel/Intel-PMT.

For example there are two energy related telemetry events for the Clearwater
Forest family of processors and the MMIO space looks like this:

Offset  RMID    Event
------  ----    -----
0x0000  0       core_energy
0x0008  0       activity
0x0010  1       core_energy
0x0018  1       activity
...
0x23F0  575     core_energy
0x23F8  575     activity

In addition the XML file provides the units (Joules for core_energy,
Farads for activity) and the type of data (fixed-point binary with
bit 63 used to indicate the data is valid, and the low 18 bits as a
binary fraction).

Finally, each XML file provides a 32-bit unique id (or guid) that is
used as an index to find the correct XML description file for each
telemetry implementation.

The INTEL_PMT_DISCOVERY driver provides intel_pmt_get_regions_by_feature()
to enumerate the aggregator instances (also referred to as "telemetry
regions" in this series) on a platform. It provides:

1) guid  - so resctrl can determine which events are supported
2) MMIO base address of counters
3) package id

Resctrl accumulates counts from all aggregators on a package in order
to provide a consistent user interface across processor generations.

Directory structure for the telemetry events looks like this:

$ tree /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
mon_data
├── mon_PERF_PKG_00
│   ├── activity
│   └── core_energy
└── mon_PERF_PKG_01
    ├── activity
    └── core_energy

Reading the "core_energy" file from some resctrl mon_data directory shows
the cumulative energy (in Joules) used by all tasks that ran with the RMID
associated with that directory on a given package. Note that "core_energy"
reports only energy consumed by CPU cores (data processing units,
L1/L2 caches, etc.). It does not include energy used in the "uncore"
(L3 cache, on package devices, etc.), or used by memory or I/O devices.
