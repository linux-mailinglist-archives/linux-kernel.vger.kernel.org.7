SPD is indeed optional, but the HDMI spec, (HDMI 1.4b, Section 8.2.1 -
Auxiliary Video information (AVI) InfoFrame) states that:

  A Source shall always transmit an AVI InfoFrame at least once per two
  Video Fields if the Source:

   * is ever capable of transmitting an AVI InfoFrame or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting YCBCR pixel encoding or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting any colorimetry other than the
     transmitted video format=E2=80=99s default colorimetry or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting any xvYCC or future enhanced
     colorimetry or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting any Gamut Metadata packet or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting any video format with multiple
     allowed pixel repetitions or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting Content Type other than =E2=80=9Cno da=
ta=E2=80=9D or,
   * is ever capable of transmitting YCC Quantization Range.

  The AVI InfoFrame shall be transmitted even while such a Source is
  transmitting RGB and non-pixel-repeated video. When a Source is not
  explicitly required to transmit AVI InfoFrames, it is recommended that
  the Source transmit AVI InfoFrames.

So it's recommended in every case, and the list kind of makes it
mandatory for how Linux uses HDMI.

Also, did we ever encounter some hardware that couldn't send AVI?

Audio is mandatory when streaming audio, DRM when using HDR, and we
don't support the others yet.

So the only we support but don't have to send is SPD.

HDMI 1.4 section 8.2.2 - Audio Infoframe states that:

  Whenever an active audio stream is being transmitted, an accurate
  Audio InfoFrame shall be transmitted at least once per two Video
  Fields.

I'd say it takes precedence over CTA-861.

And drivers would be free to ignore those.

=46rom what you described here, I think we share a similar goal and have
somewhat similar concerns (thanks, btw, it wasn't obvious to me before),
we just disagree on the trade-offs and ideal solution :)

I agree that we need to sanity check the drivers, and I don't want to go
back to the situation we had before where drivers could just ignore
infoframes and take the easy way out.

It should be hard, and easy to catch during review.

I don't think bitflag are a solution because, to me, it kind of fails
both.

What if, just like the debugfs discussion, we split write_infoframe into
write_avi_infoframe (mandatory), write_spd_infoframe (optional),
write_audio_infoframe (checked by drm_connector_hdmi_audio_init?) and
write_hdr_infoframe (checked in drmm_connector_hdmi_init if max_bpc > 8)

How does that sound?
