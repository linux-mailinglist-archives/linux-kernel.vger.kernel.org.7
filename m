OK, so it is a buggy module.

Yes, just like there's multiple causes for BUG_ON() ;-)

The ftrace_disable is used to help keep the system from being totally
corrupted. When it triggers, the best thing to do is a reboot.

Well, when a user inserts a module, then they become a kernel developer too ;-)

Actually I think both patches are buggy.

When ftrace_disabled is set, we don't know the state of the code and we do
not want to do *any* more text modification. That's what ftrace_disable
means. Something went wrong with text modification and any more changes can
cause a bigger problem.

We don't add "exceptions".

If you are worried about unloading modules when ftrace_disable is set, what
is a much safer solution is to up the module count of all modules that have
any ftrace callsites active, and prevent those modules from being removed.

Again, the only solution to a ftrace_disable being set is a full reboot.
