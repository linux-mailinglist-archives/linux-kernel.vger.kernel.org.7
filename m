Thanks, Ingo, for the detailed notes. Your feedback is very much 
appreciated.

Tool Integration
==================

We've been using a python script to process the data into a report. We 
can look at implementing this directly in perf report, if that is 
required. However, I'm nervous about making the new feature the default 
behaviour for the tool.

This feature has been integrated into our tools [1] for the last 12 
months, and has received a lot of testing on Arm Neoverse hardware. 
Other platforms have received less rigorous testing. In my opinion, more 
work would be needed to validate the PMU hardware & software 
characteristics of other architectures before this can be made the default.

Burst Sampling
================

I like the burst sampling idea. Increased I-Cache pressure is an 
inherent weakness of this sampling method, and this would help to 
alleviate that somewhat. I'll add this in the next spin.

Period Jitter
===============

Yes, we can apply this to both periods. I will make that change.

I'm not sure I've fully understood your suggestion here. In its current 
state, the 4-bit jitter field acts as a base-2 exponent. This gives us a 
random jitter value of up to 2**15. Is the suggestion to change this to 
a fixed, absolute value that can be applied to both long & short periods?


Thanks,
Mark
