with Reviewed-by I understand that you have carefully reviewed
the code line by line, agree with everything written, and do not
see any issues or major improvements to be made.

With Acked-by I understand that you have read the change and
agree with it, but you may not have gone into the fine details.
You are simply OK with the patch being applied.

With Suggested-by I understand that someone has proposed the
entire idea behind the patch, not just smaller improvements or
changes made during review. For example, if I tell you that 'ret'
does not need to be initialised and can be moved inside the for
loop, that comes from review. However, if I suggest sending a new
patch changing the function type, that would justify a
Suggested-by tag.

Then there are other tags, such as Reported-by when someone
reports an issue, and many more that you will learn if you stay
in the community (and I hope you will).

Everything is more or less documented in
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst, and when in doubt,
asking is always the right thing to do.

Again, thank you for your patches,
Andi
