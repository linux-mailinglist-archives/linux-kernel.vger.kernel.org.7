Here's my reflog, but tl;dr it looks like "b4 trailers" did it. If you
want to skip to that, search for "fast-import" below...


eef1355c269b (HEAD -> for-next/hardening, origin/for-next/hardening, for-next/kspp) HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from broken/for-next/hardening to for-next/hardening

Getting back to sfr's recommended "known good state".

This is amending "overflow: Introduce __DEFINE_FLEX for having no
initializer" and pulling down "randstruct: gcc-plugin: Fix attribute
addition" from lore to get the Tested-by tag -- but it's all going on
top of the broken for-linus/hardening, not having realized it was broken.

d316fb5f88c9 HEAD@{19}: checkout: moving from for-linus/hardening to fix-rand2

This is trying to figure out why merging didn't work, so I restarted on
master and cherry-picked the patches to a separate tree ("fix-rand2")
for testing.

This is splitting out "platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Handle KCOV __init
vs inline mismatches" so I could send it out, and then throwing away the
patch since its going via a separate tree and I need to review that whole
tree separately anyway. (This tree is still the _broken_ for-next tree...)

I was cleaning up old trees, and went back to look at old commits
(9d230d500b0e) but couldn't figure out why I was having trouble with
merge bases, and tried a rebase but it exploded. I return to the
(broken) for-next.

Checking if some expected patches have already landed in master while
cleaning up older dev trees and rebasing them forward for potential
revisions during the coming dev cycle. This appears to be sanely based
on master, not a broken tree.

Trying to figure out why I can't sanely rebase. (Note that 2e058d249588 is on a
broken base tree, repeated above. Below, c102753312e8 is on a sane tree.)

62329e859b25 (dev/v6.16-rc1-pre/-Wunterminated-string-initialization) HEAD@{56}: checkout: moving from for-next/hardening to test/kern-splat

This is where 2e058d249588 first appears, and before it is the branch
juggling of one of my scripts to send a single patch out of the middle of
a tree ("kern-splat" was a script to email the top patch, "kern-splat-one"
sends a specific sha from the tree by temporarily making a new branch,
"test/kern-splat", with that sha at the top, using "kern-splat", and
then restoring the tree to the prior state.)

But the "fast-import" is NOT part of that, but rather from "b4
trailers". I checked my reflog against my bash history...

"l" is "git log -1"
"s" is "git show"

HEAD@{54} through HEAD@{56} above is 14034 above.

HEAD@{53} and HEAD@{52} above is 14036 above.

Then I try to throw away (with 14038):

62329e859b25 (dev/v6.16-rc1-pre/-Wunterminated-string-initialization) [DUP]
9a7d4e791037 crypto: Annotate crypto strings with nonstring
b080c44c4d69 kbuild: Re-enable -Wunterminated-string-initialization

and just have "ubsan: integer-overflow: depend on BROKEN to keep this
out of CI" on top, but for some reason it shows in "git log -1" as
2e058d249588 not 8c2bb7d12601.

Now, looking at the tree for 8c2bb7d12601, I see I'm on sane "master"
base. I'll bet "b4 trailers" did something Exciting when rewriting stuff.
More below...

9d230d500b0e and 8c2bb7d12601 are sane trees. I'm pulling forward my
patches to enable -Wunterminated-string-initialization for testing, and
I find a new warning (in crypto) which I make, as well as another that
I'd already fixed before, that I split and leave as "[DUP]", then run
"kern-splat-one" on the crypto patch to get it sent[1].

c102753312e8 is based on a sane tree, I'm starting to build patches that
I'd like to land in -rc1, based on my existing for-next tree. Which gets
us back to the "known good state", per sfr.
