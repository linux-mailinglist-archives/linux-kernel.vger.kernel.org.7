Not suggesting that we need to support this, but it is technically possible
today by loading FF-A as a module—first inserting and removing a module with
v1.2 support, then loading one with v1.1 support. It can ever throw error
as not supported to keep it simple.

Agreed.

Agreed, it is *not yet" allowed. There were some thoughts for a different
use-case IIUC, need to check the status. IIRC, it was bootloader vs OS
where bootloader like UEFI might negotiate one version(usually older) and
then OS comes and request newer version. To support such a setup, we do
need some additional support in the spec and the current latest v1.2 is not
sufficient.
