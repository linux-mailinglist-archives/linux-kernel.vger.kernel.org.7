Right. That's because I was not sure we came to any conclusion yet. I
thought this discussion was still ongoing. I understand that so far
this is still all just a theory and any premature conclusions may be
misleading.

But yeah, I may write some kind of a warning or a disclaimer
mentioning the suspicion. Just so that it gets documented and it is
clear it was considered, even though maybe without a clear conclusion.

So to be perfectly clear, what sharing do you mean? Is it the
eb->start and eb->len you talking about? In other words, when getting
`start` you also get `len` for free?

Since the structure is 8 bytes aligned, they may eventually still end
up in two cachelines. Luckily the size of the structure is 0 mod 16 so
just out of the luck this never happens and they are always in the
same cache line. But this may break with future changes, so it is not
rock solid the way it is now.

I understand that. Again, this is what I originally considered. Not
all the functions end up like this but there are definitely some. And
by a rule of a thumb it's roughly half of them, give or take. That
sounds like a good reason to be concerned.

My reasoning was that the fs_info->nodesize is accessed by many so the
chances are it will be hot in cache. But you're right that this may
not always be the case. It depends. The question remains if that makes
a difference?

Another (IMO valid) point is that I believe the code will dereference
many other pointers before getting here so this may seem like a drop
in the sea. It's not like this was a tight loop scattering over
hundreds random memory addresses.
For example when this code is reached from a syscall, the syscall
itself will have significantly higher overhead then one additional
dereference. And I think the same applies when reached from an
interrupt.
Otherwise this would be visible on perf profile (which none of us
performed yet).

Still, I'd say reading the assembly is a good indication of possible
issues to be concerned with. But it's not always the best one. An
observed performance regression would be.
I'll be happy to conduct any suggested benchmarks. Though as you
mentioned this may be also picky on the used HW. So even though we
don't see any regressions with our testing, one day someone may find
some if we merged this change. In which case we can always revert.

I have to say I'm pretty happy with the positive feedback from the
other reviewers. So far you're the only one raising this concern.

So how do we conclude this?

If you don't want this cleanup I'd opt at least for rename eb->len
==>> eb->nodesize.
