According to Arm ARM for PMSNEVFR_EL1: "The overall inverted filter is
the logical OR of these filters."

Note for the subtle differences.  PMSEVFR_EL1 (Event filter) uses AND
logic but PMSNEVFR_EL1 (Inverted Event filter) uses OR logic.

Could we clarify what result if the same bit is set for both
event_filter and inv_event_filter?  Even if it is undefined.

Could we move the 'simd_filter' and 'float_filter' at here?  Something
like:

When extended filtering is supported (FEAT_SPE_EFT), SIMD and float
pointer operations can be collected:

    simd_filter=1         - Collect SIMD loads, stores and operations (PMSFCR.SIMD)
    float_filter=1        - Collect floating point loads, stores and operations (PMSFCR.FP)

Then we can talk about filter mask bits.

Please correct this, as setting the bit to 1 means no effect.
