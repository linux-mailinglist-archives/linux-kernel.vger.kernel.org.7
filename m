i actually put some words for vector_madvise:
"
 * ideally, for vector_madvise(), we are able to make the
   decision of lock types for each iteration; for this moment,
   we still use the global lock."

I held on to that one because I'd rather get feedback before going too
far - so vector_madvise() didn't be touched by having a __madvise_lock()
and __madvise_lock().

For that case, we might need to take madvise_lock after releasing it.
otherwise, this is not the case.

BTW, I found vector_madvise doesn't check the ret value of madvise_lock(),
it seems also a bug?

static ssize_t vector_madvise(struct mm_struct *mm, struct iov_iter *iter,
{
                        /* Drop and reacquire lock to unwind race. */
                        madvise_finish_tlb(&madv_behavior);
                       madvise_unlock(mm, behavior);
                       madvise_lock(mm, behavior);  /* missing the ret chec=
k */
                        madvise_init_tlb(&madv_behavior, mm)
}

we might call madvise_do_behavior() within per-vma lock but
untagged_addr_remote() always asserts a mmap_lock which
will also be asserted by find_vma in madvise_walk_vmas().
so at least for architectures other than risc-v and x86, there
is no difference.

include/linux/uaccess.h

#ifndef untagged_addr_remote
#define untagged_addr_remote(mm, addr) ({ \
              mmap_assert_locked(mm); \
              untagged_addr(addr); \
})
#endif

I didn't realize madv_dontneed could be done on a remote process,
could it?
