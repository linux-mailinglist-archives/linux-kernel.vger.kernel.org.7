Thanks a lot for testing this!

Yeah, this sounds like a bug to me...

I'm fine with this approach. My only two concerns/comments are:

 1. Let's make sure we don't waste too much time finding the ideal
    approach to implement the additional blocking, if this will likely
    end up getting removed again anyway.

 2. How can we justify making this change only for USB? Your analysis
    sounds like the issue applies to all types of output ports. This was
    exactly my main concern with the check you added in this patch:
    I would expect QDSP6 treats all ports exactly the same. This means
    we should add this additional check for all the output ports...

Thanks,
Stephan
