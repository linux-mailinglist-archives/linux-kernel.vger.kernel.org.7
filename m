My understanding is that kernel page tables are walked with no MM
locks held all the time. See for example:

 - vmalloc_to_page()
 - vmap()
 - KASAN's shadow_mapped()
 - apply_to_page_range() called from kasan_populate_vmalloc() or
arm64's set_direct_map_invalid_noflush()

This is possible because kernel-internal page tables are used for
allocations managed by kernel-internal users, and so things like the
lifetimes of page tables can be guaranteed by higher-level logic.
(Like "I own a vmalloc allocation in this range, so the page tables
can't change until I call vfree().")

The one way in which I think this is currently kinda yolo/broken is
that vmap_try_huge_pud() can end up freeing page tables via
pud_free_pmd_page(), while holding no MM locks AFAICS, so that could
race with the ptdump debug logic such that ptdump walks into freed
page tables?

I think the current rules for kernel page tables can be summarized as
"every kernel subsystem can make up its own rules for its regions of
virtual address space", which makes ptdump buggy because it can't
follow the different rules of all subsystems; and we should probably
change the rules to "every kernel subsystem can make up its own rules
except please take the init_mm's mmap lock when you delete page
tables".

(I think we should take all the vma locks in that ptdump code and get
rid of this weird exception instead of documenting it.)
