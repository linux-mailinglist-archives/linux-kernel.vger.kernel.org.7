Well, let's take docker as example:

For docker, when a client is launched and it wants to access host's
device, it must make explicit request when it's launched:

docker run --device=/dev/xxx

Let's presume that xxx is /dev/rpmsgX generated dynamically by _host_.
Docker command above knows nothing about these rpmsg nodes which are
generated by host _after_ client is launched. And yes, parsing
/sys/class/rpmsg may acquire info about rpmsg devices, but client still
can't access /dev/rpmsgX.

You have every right to do so, after all, it's purely a technical
discussion :).

I admit it's bit confusing to add annoymous inode logic to a file named
rpmsg_char.c which implies 'character' device. That's why I rename API
following Mathieu's comment:
  - __rpmsg_chrdev_eptdev_alloc ->  rpmsg_eptdev_alloc
  - __rpmsg_chrdev_eptdev_add ->  rpmsg_eptdev_add

As to topic how these two uAPI(s) co-exist and affect each other. This
change is based on rules:

1. Never break existing uAPI.
2. Try best to reuse existing codebase.
3. Userspace can choose whatever approach they want to.

Thanks,
