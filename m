I won't reject the series based on my opinion. Answering the technical concerns
will prevail.

Why is it needed to convert the timer into a module ?

In the clockevent / clocksource initialization process, depending on the
platform, some are needed very early and other can be loaded later.

For example, the usual configuration is the architected timers are initialized
very early, then the external timer is loaded a bit later. And when this one is
loaded it does not take over the architected timers. It acts as a "broadcast"
timer to program the next timer event when the current CPU is going to an idle
state where the local timer is stopped.

Other cases are the architected timers are not desired and the 'external' timer
is used in place when it is loaded with a higher rating. Some configuration can
mimic local timers by settting a per CPU timer.

Some platforms could be without the architected timers, so the 'external' timer
is used.

Let's imagine the system started, the timers are running and then we load a
module with a timer replacing the current ones. Does it work well ?

Are we sure, the timer modularization is compatible with all the timer use cases ?

We would have to check each platform individually to answer this question.

The interaction between cpuidle and the timer module is about not having a
broadcast timer when cpuidle initializes and then having it later when the
module is loaded. Did you check the deep idle states are used after loading the
module ?

The clocksource counter is stopped when it is not the current one. So when you
switch it, the new clocksource counter could be different and can make you jump
back in time.

I disagree :)

The whole point is the time framework may not be totally immune against the
timer modularization. It is about identifying the corner cases where the timer
driver modularization can have an impact and set the scene to support it.

The discussion is not about only the Exynos MCT but as you are not the first
one asking to convert the timer driver to a module, we should check what could
be the impact on the time framework and the system in general.

Others proposed to convert to module and I asked to investigate the impact.
Nobody came back with a clear answer and there is no feedback from Thomas.
