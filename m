Lol I had to rewrite my replies a few times to tone them down.
Hopefully I don't come across as aggressive :)

Thanks, will make it RFC and add that I am making changes to mm_struct and VMA logic.

So this was from the discussion with David. My initial implementation in v1,
messed with the policy evaluation in thp_vma_allowable_orders and __thp_vma_allowable_orders.

The whole point of doing it this way is that you dont mess with the policy evaluation.

hugepage_global_always and hugepage_global_enabled will still evaluate to false
when never is set and you will not get a hugepage. But more on it below.

I am ok with that. I can add a check over here that wraps this in:
if (hugepage_global_enabled())
	...

Thanks, I will put

			return 0;
at the start.

So I actually dont mind the cgroup implementation (that was actually my first
prototype and after that I saw there was someone who had posted it earlier).
It was shot down because it wont be hierarchical and doesnt solve it when
its not being done in a cgroup.

A large proportion of the thread in v1 was discussion with David, Johannes, Zi and
Yafang (the bpf THP policy author) on different ways of doing this.
