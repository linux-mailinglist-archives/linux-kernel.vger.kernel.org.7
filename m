OK, sounds good to me.

Yes, this is my point. When changing underlying linear map permission 
for vmalloc, the linear map address may be not contiguous. This is why 
change_memory_common() calls __change_memory_common() on page basis.

But how Dev's patch work should have no impact on how I implement the 
split primitive by thinking it further. It should be the caller's 
responsibility to make sure __create_pgd_mapping_locked() is called for 
contiguous linear map address range.

Yeah, sounds feasible. Anyway I will figure it out.
