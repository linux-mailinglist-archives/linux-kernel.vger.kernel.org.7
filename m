There are only 10 legacy non-cache events, but after cycles the
meaning is ambiguous and likely often just not implemented. Saying the
meaning is known because of the driver, I'm not aware of any driver
giving descriptions.

For a flag, the issue is that we prefer json when there is a PMU but
not when it is wildcarded. So when is the flag used or not?

My eventual hope is that we can standardize on sysfs encoding. So we
translate json to sysfs, then compress the files/directories and
access them built into the perf tool this way. Then, as with say
addr2line or objdump, we have a priority list like:
"sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt),legacy". Then we could allow
"sysfs(/home/ian/myevents),sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt),legacy" so users
can manually add events and metrics. A priority list for the behavior
today would be something like
"legacy(no-pmu),sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt),legacy(with-pmu)". If we
have hardware cache events at a low priority may it is
"legacy(no-pmu+type_hardware),sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt),legacy(with-pmu+ty=
pe_hw_cache)"
what this series is trying to achieve is just
"sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt),legacy" and the alternate series is
"legacy,sysfs(/sys),sysfs(inbuilt)".

On x86 events are 70% of the binary size but just compressing the json
shows that this could be halved.

Making the lookup use a list and user supplied directories may allow
us to write tests that create a hybrid looking sysfs to test on
non-hybrid, etc.

So it has been standard for Intel to have a cpu-cycles sysfs event:
```
$ cat /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/cpu-cycles
event=3D0x3c
```
I'm only aware of ARM using cycles as an event name and they also use
cpu_cycles, I wish they'd pick a lane (preferably not the one that
conflicts with a legacy event name).
I'm not particularly keen on having cycles not be wildcard (other than
for core PMUs) and meaning the legacy encoding. The issue is that the
legacy encoding will break broken PMUs like on older Apple-M linux,
and what to do in the RISC-V case?
I can understand not wanting to change what users see and I think that
may be the only expedient way to do it. I don't think anyone cares
about the cpu-cycles event name and on Intel it seems they'd prefer
the sysfs encoding, hence advertising the event.
