Sure, I that'd be possible. Perhaps I'm more wondering if it's actually
desirable, but sounds like at least that's how it was intended to be
used then.

It could, but I'm actually less worried about the parsing code (it's
relatively simple to review) than about the data model in this code, and
trying to fuzz the data model generally requires the state. See e.g.
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=3Ddc6f4dce0d707900cdea (which I
finally reproduced in a kunit test a few years after this was originally
reported.)

I mean ... I guess now I'm arguing against myself - having the state
there is required to find certain classes of bugs, but not having the
state makes it easier to figure out what's going on :-) A middle ground
would be to have some isolated state for fuzzing any particular "thing",
but not necessarily reset between rounds.

Well, chicken and egg type situation? There are no such fuzzers that are
actually easy to use and/or integrate, as far as I can tell.

I've been looking also at broader fuzzing tools such as nyx-fuzz and
related kafl [1] which are cool in theory (and are intended to address
your "cannot fork VMs quickly enough" issue), but ... while running a
modified host kernel etc. is sufficient for research, it's practically
impossible for deploying things since you have to stay on top of
security etc.

[1] https://intellabs.github.io/kAFL/tutorials/linux/fuzzing_linux_kernel.h=
tml

That said, it seems to me that upstream kvm code actually has Intel-PT
support and also dirty page logging (presumably for VM migration), so
I'm not entirely sure what the nyx/kafl host kernel actually really
adds. But I have yet to research this in detail, I've now asked some
folks at Intel who work(ed) on it.

Interesting. I mean, I do somewhat see it that way too from the
perspective of someone faced with inscrutable bug reports, but it also
seems that given enough resources/time, accumulated state lets a fuzzer
find more potential issues.

Right, mostly, the whole "I found a reproducer now" thing, I guess.

Right.

Is it really a speed-up vs. resulting in more readable reports? Possibly
even at the expense of coverage?

But anyway, making that possible was indeed what I was thinking about.
It requires some special configuration and "magic" in UML, but it seems
eminently doable. Mapping KCOV to a given fuzzer's feedback might not be
trivial, but it should be possible too. In theory you could even compile
the whole UML kernel with say afl-clang, I suppose.

I'm not entirely sure about KCOV right now, but KASAN definitely works
today (not in 2023.) I agree that adding a fuzzer on top makes it a one-
of-a-kind setup, but I guess from my perspective adding syzbot/syzkaller
(inside) is really mostly the same, since we don't run that ourselves
right now.

Fair points, though I'd like to point out that really the only reason
this is true is the syzkaller availability: that ensures fuzz tests
would run continuously/automatically, thus ensuring it's buildable
(since you try that) and thus ensuring it'd be maintained. So it all
goes back to syzkaller existing already :-)

Which I'm not arguing is bad, quite the opposite, but I'm also close to
just giving up on the whole UML thing precisely _because_ of it, since
there's no way anyone can compete with Google's deployment, and adding
somewhat competing infrastructure to the kernel will just complicate
matters. Which is maybe unfortunate, because a fork/fuzz model often
seems more usable in practice, and in particular can also be used more
easily for regression tests.

Regression, btw, is perhaps something to consider here in this patch
set? Maybe some side files could be provided with each KFuzzTest that
something (kunit?) would run to ensure that the code didn't regress when
asked to parse those files?

That's also true, I guess, in some way this infrastructure would be
available for any fuzzer to link to, especially if we do something with
UML as I was thinking about.

Which is also in part why I was asking about the state though, since a
"reset the whole state" approach is maybe a bit more amenable to
actually letting the fuzzer modify state than the current approach.

Then again, given that syzbot always modifies state, maybe I'm changing
my opinion on this and will say that I'm not so sure any more your
intention of fuzzing "low-level, relatively stateless functions" holds
that much water? If in practice syzbot is the thing that runs this, then
that doesn't matter very much apart from having to ensure that it
doesn't modify state in a way that is completely invalid - but to some
extent that'd be a bug anyway, and e.g. memory allocations of a function
can be freed by the fuzztest wrapper code.


I guess I'll research the whole nyx thing a bit more, and maybe
reconsider giving up on the UML-based fork/fuzz model, if I can figure
out a way to integrate it with KFuzzTest and run those tests, rather
than my initial intent of integrating it with kunit. Some infrastructure
could be shared, although I had hoped things like kunit asserts, memory
allocations, etc. would be available to fuzz test code just to be able
to share setup/teardown infrastructure - I guess we'll have to see how
that plays out. :)

Thanks!

johannes
