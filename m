Note, I did not blindly copy it. I knew ramoops did exactly what I wanted
to do, so I looked at how it did it. I read the code, it looked reasonable,
and I mapped it.

I needed a way to map physical memory to vmap memory. How am I supposed to
know it was not doing it the proper way?

I did not believe pstore was a random file system. It does similar code
that tracing does.

Note, even though this code lives in kernel/, it is not much different than
pstore code. It's a way to trace / debug the kernel, very much like pstore
in that it's used to debug. I saw that code was written in 2012 and thought
it was mature. It made sense, and yes I could have looked for a range, but
I trusted the people who wrote that code. This wasn't just a random looking
at something and copying it. I really wanted to understand how it worked.

And I did talk with some of the mm folks, and they seemed OK with this.

Note, this only works with RAM.

I guess you mean E820.

Mike can correct me if I'm wrong, but the memory that was stolen was actual
memory returned by the system (E820 in x86). It reserves the memory before
the memory allocation reserves this memory. So what reserve_mem returns is
valid memory that can be used by memory allocator, but is currently just
"reserved" which means it wants to prevent the allocator from using it.

I believe this is what Mike set up. A way to have normal RAM reserved
before it gets added to the memory allocator. This was by design.

In fact, if you do pull my v2[*] pull request of the ring buffer code (that
removes this user space mapping of the persistent ring buffer logic) it
actually adds the ability to free the memory and add it back into the memory
allocator.
