Right now it does not provide any advantage over a regular syscall.
Essentially it is just overhead. That said, if you do want to make a
real vDSO out of it, I'd be happy to help in that.
(I did most of the recent work on the generic vDSO infrastructure)

What advantage does userspace have from it?

This is how I understand the 32bit implementation using
ARCH_REUSE_HOST_VSYSCALL_AREA and NEW_AUX_ENT(AT_SYSINFO_EHDR, vsyscall_ehdr)
where vsyscall_ehdr comes from the hosts getauxval(AT_SYSINFO_EHDR).
But I didn't actually test this. I'll look at it again, but currently
I'm travelling.
