Indeed. Unfortunately, no one at all implemented this properly as
per spec :(.

Balloon is the worst offender here but other devices are broken
too in some configurations.


Given it has been like this for many years I'm inclined in this
instance to fix the spec not the implementations.

Yep. I tried that, and it is basically a terrible mess :(.
