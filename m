If you want housekeeping CPUs to pull timers from isolated ones, then you
need isolated CPUs to eventually be part of the hierarchy (be "available"),
because they would need to propagate their global timers up to the top.

If they propagate their global timers then they must play the whole hierarchy
game and be ready to pull the timers from any other CPUs.

Because if they propagate their timers, they must also propagate their
idle state to synchronize with the whole hierarchy and know if there is
a non-idle housekeeping CPU to take care of their timers. And if they propagate
their (non) idle state, the isolated CPUs also declare themselves as available
to handle other's timers.

And working around that would be very nasty.
