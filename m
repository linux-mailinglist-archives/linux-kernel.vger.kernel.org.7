The kernel may be taught not to touch the area, but it is tricky when
the shared page gets mapped into the usespace and what it does with it.

True. The GPC Page Size is going to be 4K. At present the RMM S2 page
size is fixed to 4K. Please note that the future RMM versions may allow
the Host to change the S2 for Realm (Globally) to something other than
4K. (e.g., a 64K host could change it to 64K S2), which allows the host
to manage the Realm S2 better (and efficient).

Irrespective of that, the patch is trying to deal with Host pagesize
(which affects sharing) vs the Realm alignment for sharing pages.
