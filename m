thanks for the info.  it's very useful to understand what's going on.

thanks too;  below is my understanding.

I guess this is already done in sig_handler_common().

(guess) this is already done on handle_signal() =3D> setup_signal_stack_si(=
).

>  * Modify the host mcontext to set registers for the signal handler

this is something which I'm not well understanding.
- do you mean the host handler when you say "for the signal handler" ?
  or the userspace handler ?
- if former (the host one), maybe mcontext is already there so, it
  might not be the one you mentioned.
- if the latter, how the original handler (the host one,
  hard_handler()) works ? even if we can call userspace handler
  instead of the host one, we need to call the host handler (and
  restorer).  do we call both ?
- and by "to set registers", what register do you mean ? for the
  registers inspected by userspace signal handler ?  but if you set a
  register, for instance RIP, as the fault location to the host
  register, it will return to RIP after handler and restart the fault
  again ?

>  * Jump back to userspace by doing a "return"

this is still also unclear to me.

it would be very helpful if you point the location of the code (at
uml/next tree) on how SECCOMP mode does.  I'm also looking at but
really hard to map what you described and the code (sorry).

all of above runs within hard_handler() in nommu mode on SIGSEGV.
my best guess is this is different from what ptrace/seccomp do.

okay.

I was wishing to update to you that I'm working on it.  So, your
comments are always helpful to me.  Thanks.
