I would call this "kernel mode" or "auto mode", where userspace should
*generally* not have to worry about huge pages, but with an option for
declaring the odd exceptional case.

Both madvise() and unprivileged prctl() currently work, and IMO should
continue to work, for declaring exceptions.

And this "user mode" or "manual mode", where applications self-manage
which parts of userspace they want to enroll.

Both madvise() and unprivileged prctl() should work here as well,
IMO. There is no policy or security difference between them, it's just
about granularity and usability.

This one I don't quite agree with, and IMO conflicts with what David
is saying as well.

I think you're conflating a safety issue with a security issue.

David is saying there can be cases where the kernel is broken, and
"never" is a production escape hatch to disable the feature until a
kernel upgrade for the fix is possible. In such a case, it doesn't
make sense to override this decision based on any sort of workload
policy, privileged or not.

The way I understand you is that you want enrollment (and/or
self-management) only for blessed applications. Because you don't
generally trust workloads in the wild enough to switch the global
default away from "never", given the semantics of always/madvise.

To me this sounds like you'd need a different mode, call it "blessed";
with a privileged interface to control which applications are allowed
to madvise/prctl-enable.
