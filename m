Hi,

This stuff isn't simple.

Actually, I am starting to think that the current MMU UML kernel also
needs a redesign with regard to signal handling and stack use in that
case. My current impression is that the design right now only permits
voluntarily scheduling. More specifically, scheduling in response to an
interrupt is impossible.

I suppose that works fine, but it also does not seem quite right.

Ah, yes, of course.

Well, endless signals only exist as long as you exit to the same
location. My suggestion was to read the user state from the mcontext
(as SECCOMP mode does it) and executing the signal right away, i.e.:
 * Fetch the current registers from the mcontext
 * Push the signal context onto the userspace stack
 * Modify the host mcontext to set registers for the signal handler
 * Jump back to userspace by doing a "return"

Said differently, I really prefer deferring as much logic as possible
to the host. This is both safer and easier to understand. Plus, it also
has the advantage of making it simpler to port UML to other
architectures.

Yes, it does not have this specific issue. But see the top of the mail
for other issues that are somewhat related.

Can we please discuss possible solutions? We can figure out the details
once it is clear how the interaction with the host should work.

I still think that the idea of using the kernel task stack as the
signal stack is really elegant. Actually, doing that in normal UML may
be how we can fix the issues mentioned at the top of my mail. And for
nommu, we can also use the host mcontext to jump back into userspace
using a simple "return".

Conceptually it seems so simple.
