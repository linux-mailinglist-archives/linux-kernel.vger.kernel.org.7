Background
----------
On Intel systems that support per-RMID telemetry monitoring each logical
processor keeps a local count for various events. When the
IA32_PQR_ASSOC.RMID value for the logical processor changes (or when a
two millisecond counter expires) these event counts are transmitted to
an event aggregator on the same package as the processor together with
the current RMID value. The event counters are reset to zero to begin
counting again.

Each aggregator takes the incoming event counts and adds them to
cumulative counts for each event for each RMID. Note that there can be
multiple aggregators on each package with no architectural association
between logical processors and an aggregator.

All of these aggregated counters can be read by an operating system from
the MMIO space of the Out Of Band Management Service Module (OOBMSM)
device(s) on a system. Any counter can be read from any logical processor.

Intel publishes details for each processor generation showing which
events are counted by each logical processor and the offsets for each
accumulated counter value within the MMIO space in XML files here:
https://github.com/intel/Intel-PMT.

For example there are two energy related telemetry events for the
Clearwater Forest family of processors and the MMIO space looks like this:

Offset  RMID    Event
------  ----    -----
0x0000  0       core_energy
0x0008  0       activity
0x0010  1       core_energy
0x0018  1       activity
...
0x23F0  575     core_energy
0x23F8  575     activity

In addition the XML file provides the units (Joules for core_energy,
Farads for activity) and the type of data (fixed-point binary with
bit 63 used to indicate the data is valid, and the low 18 bits as a
binary fraction).

Finally, each XML file provides a 32-bit unique id (or guid) that is
used as an index to find the correct XML description file for each
telemetry implementation.

The INTEL_PMT_TELEMETRY driver provides intel_pmt_get_regions_by_feature()
to enumerate the aggregator instances (also referred to as "telemetry
regions" in this series) on a platform. It provides:

1) guid  - so resctrl can determine which events are supported
2) MMIO base address of counters
3) package id

Resctrl accumulates counts from all aggregators on a package in order
to provide a consistent user interface across processor generations.

Directory structure for the telemetry events looks like this:

$ tree /sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/
mon_data
├── mon_PERF_PKG_00
│   ├── activity
│   └── core_energy
└── mon_PERF_PKG_01
    ├── activity
    └── core_energy

Reading the "core_energy" file from some resctrl mon_data directory shows
the cumulative energy (in Joules) used by all tasks that ran with the RMID
associated with that directory on a given package. Note that "core_energy"
reports only energy consumed by CPU cores (data processing units,
L1/L2 caches, etc.). It does not include energy used in the "uncore"
(L3 cache, on package devices, etc.), or used by memory or I/O devices.
