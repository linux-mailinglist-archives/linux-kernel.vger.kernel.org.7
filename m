Thanks, Sebastian, for looking into this question.

Torvald Riegel's last patch to pthread_cond_wait.c:

$ git log -n 1 --author=riegel -- pthread_cond_wait.c
commit ed19993b5b0d05d62cc883571519a67dae481a14
Author: Torvald Riegel <triegel@redhat.com>
Date:   Wed May 25 23:43:36 2016 +0200
     New condvar implementation that provides stronger ordering 
guarantees.

Speaking of ordering, the 2016 Linux Realtime Summit happened after, on 
11 October.   Torvald and Darren co-presented a talk about condition 
variables:

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/realtime/events/rt-summit2016/pthread-condvars

Torvald in his half of the talk discusses the POSIX requirement which 
necessitated a change to condvars and his redesign.  In the video at 
30:50,

Zijlstra:  Even for FIFO, in the previous slides, S2 will only wake W2, 
because W3 was not yet
eligible, but W3 might be the highest-priority waiter.  Strictly 
speaking, W3 was eligible at S2.
[p. 9, W3 was in G2, not G1, but "happened before" S2].    At S2, the 
only possible wakeup was W2,
even thought W3 might be the highest-priority waiter.

Hart: Correct.  Not in this scheme.

Zijstra: Sequence-wise, it's correct,

Hart: it's mathematically correct.

Zijlstra: But it's not the one we want to wake according to PI rules.

Hart: Yep.

Zijlstra: This scheme does not permit us doing so.

Hart: Noted.

Darren and Torvald agree that glibc cannot make pthread condvars 
PI-aware without breaking ABI.   Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Alison
