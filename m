In the alloc process, this patch does not modify the code behavior.
Regarding the free process, the if (unlikely(PageHWPoison(page)) && !order)
code handles the case where order is 0. When order is not 0, it does not
matter if __ClearPageBuddy is used to process the last page of the compound
page, because page->flags &= ~PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP; will also clear it.
Is that right?

So we need to discuss the technical aspects first, right?

Thanks for your advice, I will try.
