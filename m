So let's say you have this in your device struct:

  regulator: Either<Regulator, EnabledRegulator>,

And you want to set the voltage on it. Now you need to do:

  match &self.regulator {
    Either::Left(regulator) =3D> regulator.set_voltage(...)?,
    Either::Right(regulator) =3D> regulator.set_voltage(...)?,
  }

And you need to do that for every single method that is available on
both types. It's unergonomic and cumbersome.

Conversely, if you have:

  regulator: Regulator<Switch>,

then it's simply a matter of doing

  self.regulator.set_voltage(...)?;

It's more code. More code means more bugs. :) And it's going to be quite
a common pattern, so I think we should make it convenient.

Also it looks like `Either` is going away, which means each user will
now have to implement their own enum type.

Just took a look at the comments on v1 since I arrived late in the
discussion.

I think both approaches have scenarios where they apply. It's a bit like
Rust's borrow checker: whenever possible, you want the rules to be
enforced at compile-time, but sometimes the access patterns become too
complex so you resort to RefCell to enforce these rules dynamically.

So please don't get me wrong, I think having a dedicated type for an
enabled regulator is great design, and its use should be preferred
whenever possible ; most drivers just want to get and enable a regulator
at probe time, and `Regulator::<Enabled>::get()` would be perfect for
that.

But if we only provide that then we also put restrictions on what the C
API allows, and users with more complex use-cases will pay the price by
rewriting code that already exists (a bit more on that later).

The following comment was made on v1:

And it sounds sensible to me.

That works very well for simpler scenarios, but won't cover everything
optimally.

A common pattern is a driver (sensors come to mind, and maybe codecs)
that acquire a regulator at probe time, and enable it every time
user-space opens the device (and, conversely, disable it as the user
session closes). The driver wants the regulator to be enabled if there
is at least one user-space session opened, and only disable it when all
user-space sessions are closed. With the proposed scheme, a Rust driver
would have to keep track of the opened sessions count and disable the
regulator itself when it reaches zero - effectively duplicating what the
C API would happily do for it, with the potential of bugs being
introduced in these extra lines of code.

There was also a discussion stating that it is safer (for the hardware)
to leave a regulator on than it is to switch it off when, due to a bug,
it is released while its enable count is not zero, and I think that's a
behavior we should allow if the user expresses a need for it. Safety is
not only memory safety :) (and in this case, it is not affected anyway).

The relevant function is called `regulator_disable()`, and it may or may
not actually disable the regulator, but the consumer behaves as if it
were. I think we should keep the same nomenclature for consistency.

See my example using `Either` above. :) I hope to be forgiven for the
user-space sessions example as I believe it is easy to model.
