Hi James,

Thanks for the comments.

In the cmp_sevent() function [2], the comparison begins with checking 
sevent->desc.
Thus, the issue cannot be resolved by the patch [1].

Perhaps the simultaneous occurrence of hisi_sccl1_hha2 and hisi_sccl,hha 
is making this
commit hard to understand. This is part of the optimization I'm working 
on next, so
please ignore it for now. I will correct the PMU name and Unit in the 
next version.

Ok, i will drop this PublicDescription.
I will append one new patch to drop other hip08 uncore PMU 
PublicDescriptions.

Best regards,
