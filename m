You could split off the threaded irq stuff and the flags module.

Smaller patches are much much easier to review IMO.

Rust-analyzer has the "normalize imports" code action that can help with
that. In one of our meetings, we once discussed having a custom tool
that could merge imports, but nobody took the time to build it.

I don't see the argument here, as this re-export shouldn't really
change.

Maybe bindgen is doing some funky stuff, Gary changed the mappings a
couple months ago (from rust/ffi.rs):

    c_long =3D isize;
    c_ulong =3D usize;

So this indeed should be usize, what is going on here?

I don't think we should knowingly do something that is "not safe". If
this requires `SpinLockIrq`, then that should land first. I think
referring to a not-yet-existing type is fine.

Yes. The sentence was worded in a weird way, since in Rust, I would
normally expect that anything can happen to a value, if I give up
ownership.

Also it is not true, since the code in the function body is only run
once you use the initializer, so running this code doesn't do anything:

    let handler =3D ...;
    let flags =3D ...;
    let irg =3D ...;
   =20

    let reg =3D Registration::register(irq, flags, cstr!("foo"), handler);

    // the registration is not yet created, only an initializer for a regis=
tration.

    let reg =3D Arc::pin_init(reg);

    // now the registration has been created and the handler can be called.

Fine with me, but we could also change the C docs :)

I also was part of the discussion at some point, but dropped out & was
busy with other things. I'll move it up in my todo-list.
