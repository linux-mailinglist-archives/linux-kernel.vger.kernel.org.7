I think what you are saying is that despite going via invalid, the HW may see
this direct transition:

+----+----+----+----+
|RO,n|RO,n|RO,n|RW,n|
+----+----+----+----+
to:
+----+----+----+----+
|RO,c|RO,c|RO,c|RO,c|
+----+----+----+----+

There are 2 logical operations here. The first is changing the permissions of
the last entry. The second is changing the size of the entry.

As I understand it, it's permissible in the architecture to update the
permissions of the a PTE without break-before-make and without issuing a tlbi
afterwards; in that case the HW may apply either the old permissions or the new
permissions up until a future tlbi (after which the new permissions are
guarranteed). That's the first logical operation.

The second logical operation is permitted by FEAT_BBM level 2.

So both logical operations are permitted and the Arm ARM doesn't mention any
requirement to "separate" these operations with a tlbi or anything else, as far
as I can see.

So I would interpret that combining these 2 in the way we have should be safe.
RNGLXZ and RJQQTC give further insight into the spirit of the spec. But I agree
this isn't spelled out super clearly.

Perhaps we can move forwards based on this understanding, and I will seek some
clarifying words to be added to the Arm ARM?

Thanks,
Ryan
