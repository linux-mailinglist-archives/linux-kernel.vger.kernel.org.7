Please do not top-post, it makes things impossible to quote properly :(

Anyway, I do not understand, sorry.  You are saying that commit
(95d2b9f693ff) is just reverting other attempts at fixing a bug, that
were not fixed properly.  So why would that commit be assigned a CVE if
the bugs were not being fixed properly?  What vulnerability does that
commit itself fix?

Did it not fix those issues?  If not, we can reject that CVE, please let
us know.

So this commit did not actually do anything?  If so, we can reject this
CVE.

But you say that commit is broken?

So, everything is now reverted and we are back at the beginning with the
original problem?

I'm sorry, but I really do not understand here what to do.  What exactly
are you wanting us to do?  Is the issue resolved?  If not, why not?  If
so, what commit fixed it?  Are there CVEs assigned to commits that are
not actually fixes?

totally confused,
