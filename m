While that is the commonly agreed interpretation today, I do not see
any language in the DT spec itself or kernel Documentation/devicetree
that would mandate aliases to be used in this way.

In fact there are examples to the contrary like
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/samsung_uart.yaml which says:
"Each Samsung UART should have an alias [...] as specified by User's
Manual of respective SoC."

So I would argue that there is no hard line between correct/incorrect
for the historical usage of the alias nodes on the i.MX platform.

Some usecases depend on the aliases being the same between kernel and
bootloader. Historically that has been guaranteed on the i.MX platform
by the aliases in the SoC DTSI, when the board didn't have a need to
change them. With this series applied some other users may now end up
with missing aliases if the only include the DTSI.

I am not too sympathetic about out-of-tree users myself, but I don't
think we should make their life harder deliberately.

In this specific case I don't see a need to change the existing code.=C2=A0

If new SoCs should change the alias use, this is something that can be
implemented on the SoC maintainer level. No need to introduce churn on
the existing platforms to enforce a new rule for newly introduced SoCs.

As I don't see the current usage as objectively wrong, I don't see the
need to do this cleanup/rework to the existing SoC DTSIs.

Yes, there is no formal ABI guarantee with this anywhere, so we can
break out-of-tree user when needed. However, I don't think the
improvements in this patchset justify such breakage.
