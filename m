I thought these tracepoints were intended to be used by RV, in which
case I'd have thought we'd want as much coverage as possible to reason
about what the kernel is actually doing.

This seems to be an argument for removing kprobe_page_fault() entirely,
which is fine, but while it exists it's not obvious to me how it's
supposed to interact with RV.

I suppose the pragmatic thing to do would be to align as closely as
possible with x86, but any documentation/guidance/tests to help us
maintain that would be really helpful. Otherwise, this feels like we're
going to have a repeat of the syscall entry mess where the interaction
with ptrace, audit, seccomp etc was perpetually broken in user-visible
ways.
