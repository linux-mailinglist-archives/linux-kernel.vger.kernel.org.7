Your approach sounds interesting.

IIUC, the approach can be intergrated with the existing numa hinting
mechanism as well, so as to perform weighted interleaving migration for
promotion, which may result in suppressing the migration anyway tho, in
MPOL_WEIGHTED_INTERLEAVE set.

Do you have plan for the that too?

Plus, it'd be the best if you share the improvement result rather than
the placement data.
