I suspect that device-tree maintainers will not accept changing an
existing binding to a different type, as it would break existing
device-trees. In this case changing an already defined boolean property
to an enum type. But I had the same idea :)

I will start working on bootloader support for these devices next week,
so for what I am concerned, I can live with doing something like
proposed here as a temporary out-of-tree solution.

What do you think, should we leave it in the current state, or can we
figure out a way to allow the driver to actively change the watchdog
reset to go to SNVS power state?
