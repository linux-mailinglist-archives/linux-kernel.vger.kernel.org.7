Dang. Thanks for checking.

I've got a pile of crappy/generic HDMI to VGA adapters and I've had
mixed success with them working. They're not really passive adapters,
so they somehow need power to convert the HDMI to VGA. They seem to
run off the power given to them by the HDMI port and I've seen cases
where (I suspect) they get into a bad state. I've seen cases where
they need to be plugged in at just the right time in order to work and
I suspect that there's some sort of chicken-and-egg problem here.
Maybe in most states the HDMI port doesn't get power if nothing is
plugged in but (because of their design) they can't report plugged in
without getting power? ...but then there are maybe some cases where
power is given anyway? I'm spitballing here.

I don't know much about the Extron DVI-RGB 200.

Do you happen to have anything that's just a normal HDMI sink, like a
TV or a standard monitor that takes HDMI?

Ah, I get it. On many device tree boards people use a dts file that
lives in the Linux source base and then bundle it with the kernel.
Looks like yours is provided by your firmware?

Super weird. So every other boot works?

I guess I'd be interested in other types of tests to see what's going
on. Aside from trying some other, more standard HDMI sinks, I'd love
to see the results of:

1. HDMI is supposed to be hotpluggable. If you've got a boot where the
display isn't working, what if you unplug the HDMI and plug it back
in. Does it fix it?

2. Does the hotplug experience change if you boot with the revert?
AKA: boot up with the revert (so everything is working normally),
unplug HDMI, wait a few seconds, plug HDMI back in? Is this different
than #1?

3. What about if you fully power off and then power on? Does the
display work reliably in this case, or are things different between
ToT and with the revert?

4. What about if you fully power off, unplug the HDMI, wait a few
seconds, plug the HDMI, and power on? Does that work? Are things
different between ToT and with the revert?

Thanks! dmesg could still be useful but I was hoping for some error
messages. I guess not.
