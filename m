So, inherently the point of proxy is that tasks get to run on borrowed time=
.
Priority inversions from any restrictions via cgroups are resolved
only by letting the task run using the donors time. So for proxy to
work we have to allow those tasks to effectively break through their
restrictions to release the needed locks.

So I'm not sure, outside of accounting everything onto the donor
(which creates its own oddities, which motivated this patch) one could
be perfectly consistent here.

I still think the model used in this patch feels like the best
balance. But I'm wondering, would accounting the "borrowed time" and
the "donated time" separately maybe help folks interpret things more
clearly?

Ah! Ok, this is a good point. I misinterpreted the
account_group_exec_runtime() as being cgroup related not thread group.
Thanks for pointing this out!

I'll take a swing at fixing the account_group_exec_runtime(), but let
me know if you have any more thoughts on how we charge cputime between
donor cgroups and proxy tasks running on the donors time.

Ok.
/me quietly deletes that patch from his WIP series. :)

Thanks so much again for the review and feedback here! Very much appreciate=
