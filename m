I went looking for reference implementations and came across this
"GmSSL" project and located:

https://github.com/guanzhi/GmSSL/blob/master/src/sm2_sign.c#L271
which uses some routines from
https://github.com/guanzhi/GmSSL/blob/master/src/sm2_z256.c

I have no idea what the deal actually is here -- is this any good? has
anybody looked at it? is it a random github? -- but it certainly
_resembles_ something more comfortable than the MPI code. Who knows, it
could be terrible, but you get the idea.
