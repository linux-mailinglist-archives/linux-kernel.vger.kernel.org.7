Hi Lorenzo,

This change has two parts: a non-functional refactoring work of moving
function from mseal.c to madvise.c, and a functional change to the
behavior of madvise under mseal. Would you consider splitting the
change into two parts? which seems to be a common practice at
supplying patches in lkml.

This is part one of a non-functional refactoring work to move a
function from mseal.c to madvise.c.

There are two main reasons why I initially wanted to keep all
mseal-related functions in mseal.c:

1 Keeping all mseal related logic in mseal.c makes it easier for
developers to find all the impacted areas of mseal.
2 mseal is not supported in 32 bits, and mseal.c is excluded from 32
bits build (see makefile).This would prevent accidentally using mseal
in code paths shared between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. It also
avoids adding #Ifdef in the .c file, which is recommended by the mm
coding standard (I received comments about avoiding  #ifdef in .c  in
the past).

Point 2 can go aways if 32 bits mseal support is coming soon, same as
my other comments for patch 1/5.

Point 1 remains. However, I want to focus on the functional change
part of this patch, rather than the other aspects.

This is the functional change and the most important area that I would
like to discuss in this patch series.

Since Jann Horn first highlighted [1] the problematic behavior of
destructive madvise for anonymous mapping during initial discussions
of mseal(), the proper solution has been open to discussion and
exploration. Linus Torvalds has expressed interest [2] in fixing this
within madvise itself, without requiring mseal, and I copied it here
for ease of reference:

=E2=80=9CHmm. I actually would be happier if we just made that change in
general. Maybe even without sealing, but I agree that it *definitely*
makes sense in general as a sealing thing.=E2=80=9D

After mseal was merged, Pedro Falcato raised a valid concern regarding
file-backed private mappings. The issue is that these mappings can be
written to, and subsequently changed to read-only, which is precisely
the problem this patch aims to fix. I attempted to address this in
[3]. However, that patch was rejected due to the introduction of a new
vm_flags, which was a valid rejection as it wasn't the ideal solution.
Nevertheless, it sparked an interesting discussion, with me raising a
point that userspace might use this feature to free up RAM for
file-backed private mapping that is never written to,  and input about
this topic from Vlastimil Babka [4] is about MADV_COLD/MADV_PAGEOUT.

A detail about userspace calling those madvise for file-backed private
mapping. Previously, I added extra logging in the kernel, and observed
many instances of those calls  during Android phone startup, although
I haven=E2=80=99t delved into the reason behind why user space calls those,
e.g. if it is from an individual app or Android platform.

Incidentally, recently while I was studying selinux code, particularly
exemod permission [5] , I learned that selinux utilizes vma->anon_vma
to identify file-backed mappings that have been written to.  Jann
pointed out to me that the kernel creates a COW mapping when a private
file-backed mapping is written. Now I'm wondering if this could be the
answer to our problem. We could try having destructive madvise check
vma->anon_vma and reject the call if it's true. I haven't had a chance
to test this theory yet, though.

To summarize all the discussion points so far:
1. It's questionable behavior for madvise to allow destructive
behavior for read-only anonymous mappings, regardless of mseal state.
2. We could potentially fix point 1 within madvise itself, without
involving mseal, as Linus desires.
3. Android userspace uses destructive madvise to free up RAM, but I
need to take a closer look at the patterns and usage to understand why
they do that.
4. We could ask applications to switch to non-destructive madvise,
like MADV_COLD or MADV_PAGEOUT. Or, another option is that we could
switch the kernel to use non-destructive madvise implicitly for
destructive madvise in suitable situations.
5. We could investigate more based on vma->anon_vma

The test you are updating is not intended for the scenario this patch
is aimed to fix: i.e. the scenario:
1. A MAP_PRIVATE R/W file-backed mapping is established.
2. The mapping is written to, which backs it with anonymous memory.
3. The mapping is mprotect()'d read-only.
4. The mapping is mseal()'d.

The test case doesn't include steps 1, 2, and 3, is it possible to
keep the existing one and create a new test case? But I don't think
that's the main discussion point. We can revisit test cases once we've
fully discussed the design.

Thanks and regards,
-Jeff
