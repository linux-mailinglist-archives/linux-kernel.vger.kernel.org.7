Okay, so you admit that your "accelerator" is much slower than the CPU.  So (1)
does not apply.

As for (2), it's not clear that applies here.  Sure, your AES engine *by itself*
may be more power-efficient than the AES instructions on the CPU.  However,
using the offload requires all the additional work associated with offloading
the operation from the CPU.  Since it's much slower, it will also cause the
operation to be dragged out over much a longer period of time, keeping the
system awake for longer when it could have gone into suspend earlier.

Thus, using the "accelerator" could actually increase power usage.

As for (3), a couple issues.  First, you're just making an argument from
generalities and are not claiming that it's actually true in this case.  ARMv8
CE instructions are in fact constant time.

Sure, ARMv8 CE is generally not hardened against power analysis attacks.  But
you haven't actually claimed that your crypto engine is either.

Second, these side channels, especially the ones other than timing, just aren't
part of the threat model of most users.

Meanwhile, a security issue we do have is that the hardware drivers tend not to
be tested before the kernel is released, and often are released in a broken
state where they don't even do the en/decryption correctly.  Furthermore,
unprivileged userspace programs may use AF_ALG to exploit buggy drivers.

It seems implausible that this patch is more helpful than harmful.
