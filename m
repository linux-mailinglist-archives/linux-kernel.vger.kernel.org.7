If you log in from another terminal? Anything that creates a new
process for that user but isn't inherited will be missed, which isn't
merely a race.

We could have other events and try to discover new processes via them,
do things like dummy events to cover races. It is just a lot of
complexity for something that is a trivial amount of BPF. In something
like 10 years nobody has bothered to fix this up.

For `perf top` with TUI you get an error message in a box of:
```
failed to set filter "BPF" on event cpu_atom/cycles/P with 1
(Operation not permitted)
```
With --stdio you get:
```
libbpf: Error in bpf_object__probe_loading(): -EPERM. Couldn't load
trivial BPF program. Make sure your kernel supports BPF
(CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=3Dy) and/or that RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is set to big enough
value.
libbpf: failed to load object 'sample_filter_bpf'
libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'sample_filter_bpf': -EPERM
Failed to load perf sample-filter BPF skeleton
failed to set filter "BPF" on event cpu_atom/cycles/P with 1
(Operation not permitted)
```
This matches the existing behavior if you put a filter on an event.
