Subject: Activities of Singapore Government hackers inside Teo En Ming's An=
droid (Linux) phone - 28 May 2025 Report

Good day from Singapore,

I recall 1-2 years ago, Singapore Government hackers deleted 2 selfie photo=
s I took with celebrities/artistes from my vivo V25 Pro 5G Android (Linux) =
phone. I had to restore the selfie photos from the "Recently deleted" folde=
r.

On 7 March 2025, Singapore Government hackers changed the name of my phone =
contact from "Michael Chen Photographer" to "Michen Chen Photographer".

Inside the WhatsApp messages that I had sent to myself, dated 3 April 2022,=
 I think "Michael Chen" was also changed to "Michen Chen" by Singapore Gove=
rnment hackers.

Then on 10 May 2025, Singapore Government hackers changed the name of my ph=
one contact from "Hairy Ted Events" to "Hairy Ted Ted Events".

Yesterday 27 March 2025 Tuesday, I had visited my mother at IMH from 3.00 P=
M to 6.00 PM.

While visiting my mother at IMH, I checked through my Singtel mobile phone =
bills from April 2025 to May 2025.

To my surprise, I discovered that Singapore Government hackers had made an =
unauthorized long distance IDD 001 call from Singapore to Germany in my Apr=
il 2025 Singtel mobile phone bill.

Details of the long distance IDD 001 call are as follows:

Date: 3 April 2025
Time: 7.31 am
Country: Germany
Called No.: 4989262034700
Duration: 5.0 Min(s)
Charges: SGD$5.25

Singtel mobile phone bill ID: 000173084076

I remember 3 Apr 2025 very vividly. 3 Apr 2025 is my last day of service wi=
th SBS Transit Ltd as Network Operations Engineer/IT Infrastructure Special=
ist.

On the morning of 3 Apr 2025, Singapore Government hackers had corrupted th=
e Android (Linux) operating system on my vivo V25 Pro 5G Android (Linux) ph=
one.

In the afternoon of 3 Apr 2025 the same day, I had sent my vivo phone to Vi=
vo Service Center at International Plaza in Singapore for servicing.

Vivo Service Center technicians acknowledged that my Android (Linux) phone =
had been hacked/compromised.

They proceeded to erase/format my vivo phone and re-install the Android (Li=
nux) operating system from scratch.

Even AFTER Vivo Service Center technicians had erased/formatted my vivo pho=
ne and reinstalled the Android (Linux) operating system from scratch, Singa=
pore Government hackers still managed to hack into my Android (Linux) phone=
 AGAIN, very very quickly. How many times must I send my Android (Linux) ph=
one to Vivo Service Center to reinstall the Android (Linux) operating syste=
m from scratch? 10,000 times? 10 billion times?

I do not remember making long distance IDD 001 call from Singapore to Germa=
ny on 3 Apr 2025.

I repeat.

I do not remember making long distance IDD 001 call from Singapore to Germa=
ny on 3 Apr 2025.

Hence, Singapore Government hackers must have made the unauthorized long di=
stance IDD 001 call from Singapore to Germany on 3 April 2025.

Now, I have a habit of sending WhatsApp messages to MYSELF to record inform=
ation such as what time I sleep, what time I wake up, what time I take sema=
glutide (weight loss medication), what time I take the morning medication, =
what time I take the night medication and of course various other informati=
on.

Since 26 May 2025, I discovered that some WhatsApp messages that I had sent=
 to MYSELF were missing and/or were deleted.

Needless to say, Singapore Government hackers must have deleted some of my =
WhatsApp messages.

On 26 MARCH 2025, Singapore Government hackers sent a message to Meta AI on=
 my WhatsApp app. The message goes: "I need help finding a job".

I do not recall asking Meta AI on WhatsApp app such a message. Hence, Singa=
pore Government hackers must have sent that message without my knowledge.

Singapore Government hackers can easily hack into my Android (Linux) phone =
and maintain ABSOLUTE and TOTAL control over my Android (Linux) phone. Sing=
apore Government hackers can do practically ANYTHING inside my Android (Lin=
ux) phone, since my have UNFETTERED access to my Android (Linux) phone.

I am still wondering why Android (Linux) phones are so easy for Singapore G=
overnment hackers to hack into. Why? Why? Why?

Is there any way that Linux kernel developers can improve the security of A=
ndroid (Linux) phones so that government hackers won't be able to hack into=
 Android (Linux) phones so easily? Increased collaboration with various And=
roid phone manufacturers to improve their security??

Thank you very much.
