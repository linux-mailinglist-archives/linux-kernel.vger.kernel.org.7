I believe that is true.  I considered adding it, but when I put debug
code in to trace what was happening, it was being rejected, in one
place, so the other didn't need to.  If the general consensus is to
have it in both places, I can add it.

I've been working on creating some caching to determine the best
values for the PHY and remember them, so the work doesn't have to be
done again if the next call uses the same clock rate.  I'm not quite
ready to submit it, because I need to rebase it on Linux-Next with
some of the other updates requested by Uwe.  My updates also remove
the look-up table completely and use an algorithm to determine the
fractional divider values - thanks to Frieder's python code that I
ported to C.  I experimented quite a bit with which values have more
impact and reorganized his nested for-loops to keep track of how many
iterations are done and also measuring the time it takes to do the
calculations, so the code doesn't really look like his as much as one
would think.

The downside with my updates is that running 'modetest'  on the 4K
monitor that I use has so many entries, the time it takes to calculate
all the values for the monitor takes a second or two longer than
before, because searching the LUT is quick and doing a series of
for-loops to find the nominal values is more time consuming.  We could
potentially keep the LUT and only use this new calculation if the
entry isn't in the LUT.  I am not generally a fan of LUT's if the
values can be calculated, but I can also see the advantage of speed.

I am not sure where these values came from either.

If you want, I can submit my stuff as an RFC to give it a try and
solicit feedback.
