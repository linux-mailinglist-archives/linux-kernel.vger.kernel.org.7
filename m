Perhaps remove the double "valid". Usually people use the phrase "any
valid A is a valid B" to say that B is a superset of A, but it is
opposite here.

Is there theoretical reason that functions to get/set variables cannot
be generated? Or you just do not have time for it yet?

"callback for timers armed when entering the state is in fact a failure
in the model and triggers a reaction." - I have problem parsing this
sentence. How can "callback for timers" be armed? Or do you mean arming
timers while entering a state is a failure in the model? What is it a failure?

How about having some sort of a "background task" which periodically
verifies the invariants?
