Hi Omar,

Thank you so much for the detailed guidance and thoughtful suggestions.
I really appreciate your insights on maintainership, version compatibility,      
and the organization of drgn scripts — that context is super helpful.

Given the nature of this script, which is fairly tightly coupled to the current
kernel’s memory subsystem and primarily intended to assist mm subsystem
developers, I’m leaning toward submitting it under `tools/mm/` in the kernel tree
for now. I believe it aligns with similar precedents like
`tools/rcu/rcu-cbs.py` and `tools/cgroup/memcg_slabinfo.py`.

That said, I’d absolutely be happy to contribute future scripts to the drgn
`contrib/` directory — especially those that are more generic or extended
to support multiple kernel versions. Your feedback has been very helpful
in shaping how I think about future tooling work in this space.

Thanks again for your support and for maintaining drgn!

Thanks,
Ye Liu
