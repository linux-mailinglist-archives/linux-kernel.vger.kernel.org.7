Yup, my current plan is to use request_firmware. If it is good enough 
security wise for remoteproc, it should be fine here as well.

Well, when I say a lot of work, I don't mean codewise. That will be 
pretty simple actually. The problem I foresee is convincing everything 
in different subsystems. Basically, a lot of discussions.

Still, I do think figuring these things out now would be best in the 
long run. After all, while I cannot say for everyone else, I want to use 
this setup for at least MikroBUS, Grove, PocketBeagle 2 connector, 
BeagleBone Black connector, and RPI (for BeagleY-AI) connector.
