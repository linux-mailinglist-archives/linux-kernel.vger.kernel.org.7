Userspace should currently get-one-reg a freshly reset VCPU to know what
KVM SBI decides is the correct reset.  Userspace shouldn't set-one-reg
anything other than what KVM decides, hence we can currently just let
KVM do it.

That can also be a solution, but it's not possible to capture the
desired reset state with current IOCTLs, because the first run of a VCPU
can just as well be a resume from a mid-execution.

Right, I like the idea.  (It doesn't fix current userspaces, though.)

Both are correct...  I should have made the context clearer here.
I meant the initial hart boot, where userspace loads code/dt and sets
pc/a1 to them.

Incorrect might have been too strong word... while the SBI reset state
is technically UNSPECIFIED, I think it's just asking for bugs if the
harts have different initial states based on their reset method.

WAAAA! :)

It does.  With conditions to be as compatible as possible.

Yes.  (It needs an userspace toggle if we care about
backward-compatiblity, though.)

How much do we want to fix/break current userspaces?

Thanks.
