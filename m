Hi,
I have a general question about DCD.

How will the start dpa of the first region be set before any extent is
offer to the hosts?

In this series, no dpa gap (skip) is allowed between static capacity and
dynamic capacity. That seems to imply some component that knows the layout
of the host memory will need to set the start dpa of the first dc region?
The firmware?

Also, if a DC extent is shared among multiple hosts each of which has
different memory configuration, how the dcd device provides the extents
to each host to make sure there is no dpa gap between static and dynamic
capacity range on all the hosts?
It seems the start dpa of dcd needs to be different for each host. No sure how
to achieve that.

> 
> - Configuring a DC partition found in hardware.

> - Enhancing the CXL and DAX regions for dynamic capacity support
> 	a. Maintain a logical separation between hardware extents and
> 	   software managed extents.  This provides an abstraction
> 	   between the layers and should allow for interleaving in the
> 	   future
> 
> - Get existing hardware extent lists for endpoint decoders upon region
>   creation.

> - Respond to DC capacity events and adjust available region memory.
>         a. Add capacity Events
> 	b. Release capacity events
> 
> - Host response for add capacity
> 	a. do not accept the extent if:
> 		If the region does not exist
> 		or an error occurs realizing the extent
> 	b. If the region does exist
> 		realize a DAX region extent with 1:1 mapping (no
> 		interleave yet)
> 	c. Support the event more bit by processing a list of extents
> 	   marked with the more bit together before setting up a
> 	   response.
> 
> - Host response for remove capacity
> 	a. If no DAX device references the extent; release the extent
> 	b. If a reference does exist, ignore the request.
> 	   (Require FM to issue release again.)
> 	c. Release extents flagged with the 'more' bit individually as
> 	   the specification allows for the asynchronous release of
> 	   memory and the implementation is simplified by doing so.

> - Modify DAX device creation/resize to account for extents within a
>   sparse DAX region
> 
> - Trace Dynamic Capacity events for debugging
> 
> - Add cxl-test infrastructure to allow for faster unit testing
>   (See new ndctl branch for cxl-dcd.sh test[1])
> 
> - Only support 0 value extent tags

> Fan Ni's upstream of Qemu DCD was used for testing.

> Remaining work:
> 
> 	1) Allow mapping to specific extents (perhaps based on
> 	   label/tag)
> 	   1a) devise region size reporting based on tags
> 	2) Interleave support
> 
> Possible additional work depending on requirements:
> 
> 	1) Accept a new extent which extends (but overlaps) already
> 	   accepted extent(s)
> 	2) Rework DAX device interfaces, memfd has been explored a bit
> 	3) Support more than 1 DC partition
