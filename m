Not really. There are two issues which ultimately made us move away
from read I/O as path checkers:

- Spurious timeouts due to blocked or congested submission
- Error handling delays and stalls

When using normal read/write functions for path checking you are
subjected to normal I/O processing rules, ie I/O is inserted
at the end of the submission queue. If the system is busy the
path checker will time out prematurely without ever having reached
the target. One could avoid that by extending the timeout, but that
would make the path checker unreliable.

But the real issue is error handling. Path checker are precisely there
to check if the path is healthy, and as such _will_ be subjected
to error handling (or might even trigger error handling itself).
The thing about error handling is that you can only return affected
commands once error handling is complete, as only then you can be
sure that no DMA is pending on the buffers and one can free/re-use
the associated pages.
On SCSI error handling can be an _extremely_ lengthy affair
(we had reports for over one hour), and the last thing you want is
to delay your path checker for that time.

(And besides, I didn't even mention the third problem with I/O-based
path checkers, namely that the check entirely the wrong thing; we
are not interested whether we can do I/O, we are interested in whether
we can send commands. In the light of eg ALUA these are two very
different things.)

Precisely.

I think the best way forward here is to have a 'post_ioctl' handler
(much like we have a pre_ioctl handler nowadays).
This would check the return code from the ioctl, and invalidate the
current path if there was an I/O error.
That way the user can resubmit the ioctl, until all paths are exhausted.
For that to work we need to agree on two error codes, one for
'path failed, retry' and one for 'path failed, no retry possible'.
Resetting path status will be delegated to multipathd, but then that's
its main task anyway.

Cheers,

Hannes
