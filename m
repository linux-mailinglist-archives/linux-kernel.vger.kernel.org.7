Some hardware specific value, that would have to come from the DT...

Can re-used across levels, but because they can also be sparse its equally valid for them
to be unique. This is what is happening on arm64 ACPI platforms.

ACPI currently requires some kernel interaction too as the value gets written to some
platform specific register. Even if it did get standardised, I guess something like VFIO
would manage access to that register to fix up the values.
