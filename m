Dear CVE Community,

As the author of commit 4e7f1644f2ac ("smb: client: Fix netns refcount imbalance
causing leaks and use-after-free"), I want to clarify some confusion around the
proper fixes for these issues:

1. Commit 4e7f1644f2ac is currently associated with CVE-2025-22077. However, this
patch was merely attempting to fix issues introduced by commit e9f2517a3e18 ("smb:
client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod").

2. As I've previously discussed with Greg Kroah-Hartman on the kernel mailing list[1],
    commit e9f2517a3e18 (which was intended to address CVE-2024-54680):
    - Failed to address the actual null pointer dereference in lockdep
    - Introduced multiple serious issues:
      - Socket leak vulnerability (bugzilla #219972)
      - Network namespace refcount imbalance (bugzilla #219792)

3. Our testing and analysis confirms that the original fix by Kuniyuki Iwashima,
commit ef7134c7fc48 ("smb: client: Fix use-after-free of network namespace."), is
actually the correct approach. This patch properly handles network namespace
reference counting without introducing the problems that e9f2517a3e18 did.

4. The proper resolution for these issues was ultimately commit 95d2b9f693ff
("Revert 'smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod'"), which reverted
the problematic patch. In the latest Linux mainline code, the problematic patch and
my subsequent fix patch have been reverted.[2][3]

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I'm happy to provide additional details if needed.
