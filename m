 Thank you for the clarification.  By "silly embedded nonsense hacks" I 
suppose you refer to missing instruction emulation, which some platforms 
do so as to contain legacy support in a single place and let the rest of 
the code base assume the required feature is there, relieving maintainers 
from extra burden, correct?

 Which I just did; I think that's exactly what an RFC is about, isn't it?
