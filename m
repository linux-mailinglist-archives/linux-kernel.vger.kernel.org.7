Hi Shakeel,

Thank you for your detailed feedback and sorry for the late reply.
I need a bit more time to thoroughly review the case.

Currently, our goal is to address the hung task issue caused by the
jbd2 handle which
has a high probability of occurring in our scenario and is more likely
to cause problems.
The patch only involves APIs used within the start/stop_this_handle()
context in jbd2,
such as memalloc_nofs_save() and can be used in other lock contexts.
Please refer to patch 2 for further details. It appears
that Btrfs employs a similar transactional mechanism via btrfs_trans_handle=
, and
makes use of memalloc_nofs_save() to safeguard metadata allocations.
For example,
see commit 84de76a2fb21 ("btrfs: protect space cache inode alloc with
GFP_NOFS").
But I'm not sure if the same problem exists.

Yes, you are right =E2=80=94 we need to identify and fix these issues case =
by
case. However,
we currently have a similar mechanism, like memalloc_nofs_save(), to
handle this.
An automated approach would definitely be better, or alternatively, we
could introduce
a new memory interface to delay memory reclaim until returning to userspace=

Yes, the same scenario can occur during global reclaim =E2=80=94 we have en=
countered it.
However, global memory shortages are difficult to resolve. Maybe we
can aggressively
trigger the OOM killer before tasks enter the uninterruptible (UN) state.
Or, a more aggressive approach would be to reduce the number of direct
reclaim retries,
allowing earlier access to memory reserves if the task holds the
global resource.
It is hard to balance.

The gpf_nofail is already breaking the memory.max semantics and this patchs=
et
is just breaking the limit in kernel context, and trying to reclaim or
oom on return
back to userspace. IIUC, memory.high will slow down the task, but we
would prefer
to kill the pod and let it be rescheduled on another machine, rather
than having it blocked.

Thanks to Jan Kara for providing a detailed explanation in the letter
above. It is a shared global resource that's held by the process doing recl=

This kernel is 5.15+,  I think this problem is still here

Parsing: 17861706
#define ___GFP_HIGHMEM 0x02
#define ___GFP_MOVABLE 0x08
#define ___GFP_IO 0x40
#define ___GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM 0x400
#define ___GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM 0x800
#define ___GFP_NOFAIL 0x8000
#define ___GFP_HARDWALL 0x100000
#define ___GFP_SKIP_KASAN_POISON 0x1000000
There is no such patch a75ffa26122b, and I think it is reasonable but
the task holding
the jbd2 handle is not a dying task.

The nr_retries is MAX_RECLAIM_RETRIES, and the mem_cgroup not in oom,
mem_cgroup 0xffff8c82a27c0800 | grep oom
  oom_group =3D false,
  oom_lock =3D false,
  under_oom =3D 0

Maybe we enter the try_charge_memcg in the first loop.
I will explain it later.

Hi Shakeel

I'm a bit confused here because I don't see any "oom_reaper: unable
to reap pid..." or "Killed process %d (%s) total-vm:%lukB ..." messages
in the dmesg output. However, I did find many tasks with a pending
SIGKILL signal.

If these tasks weren't killed by the OOM killer, why do they have SIGKILL
pending in shrink context? That's why I'm unsure about this part.
Please have a look=EF=BC=9A

I completely agree. Doesn=E2=80=99t this mean that we should have a mechani=
sm
or a flag to indicate when a task is holding global resources or locks, so
that appropriate decisions can be made in global and memcg memory
reclaim contexts, in order to avoid holding locks or resources for an exten=
ded
period of time?  It would be better if we can have an automated approach th=
at
solves all the problems.
