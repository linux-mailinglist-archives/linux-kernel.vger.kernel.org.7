Because this represents a actual device users run. It is electronically,
physically impossible to run the SoC alone.

There are few - one or two - exceptions for the SoMs, but never for SoC.

I am not discussing about style of the compatible. I said - you cannot
have SoC compatible alone. None of above gives any argument for that.

google,soc-id-0005-rev-00 is the soc compatible string.

Sorry but no. Writing bindings do not request having two compatibles for
the same soc in two different, independent (orthogonal) lists.

So it is rev-xyz + google,lga-frankel + soc-id + lga, if you need that
soc-id part.

I meant ect node, existing hunk. Properties must be defined in top-level.

Yes, actually now I see you could drop the "not:" and exchange the
"then:else:" branches.
