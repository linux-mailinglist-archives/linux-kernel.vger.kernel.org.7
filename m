Can't we just update the FF-A driver? This is clearly all the result of
a half-baked spec...

Sudeep -- any chance you can add support for the hot-off-the-press
64-bit FFA_RUN call to the Linux driver, please? Without that, I don't
see how the REQ2/RESP2 calls can work properly.

That's actually a really interesting point...

The passthrough code in __kvm_hyp_host_forward_smc() assumes SMC64 and
populates/reloads X0-X17 across the SMC. If the firmware replies to an
SMC32 call with an SMC64, then so be it, but it's not the hypervisor's
job to fix that up and the same problem would presumably happen even if
the hypervisor wasn't present.

So perhaps there's an argument that the proxy should be consistent with
that behaviour, otherwise we end up with different semantics depending
on whether we chose to proxy the call or pass it through. That would
mean always populating X8-X17 in the return value, regardless of the
function ID or anything else.

The spec should still be fixed because the current wording makes very
little sense in this area, but in the meantime maybe it's best just to
pass the hot potato between the host and the firmware rather than try to
fix it up ourselves.

Marc -- what do you think? We're damned if we do, damned if we don't,
but there's something to be said for being consistent when we get into
this messy situation.
