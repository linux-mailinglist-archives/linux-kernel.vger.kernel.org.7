I've run into SCSI arrays that always act like they were called with the
ALL_TG_PT flag set (or perhaps they were just configured that way, I
never could get a straight answer about that). libmpathpersist accepts
this flag, and only sends one registration per initiator & target device
when it's set, instead of one per initator & target port. dm-multipath
currently doesn't have the knowledge necessary to figure out which
devices it needs to send reservations to, even if the kernel PR API
supported this.

But I supposed it could just send the registration normally down one
path and if that works, it could just ignore the existing key when it
sends the registration down all the other paths.
