I guess I just interpret that differently than you do.  I think
of the device compatible string as saying "this is what I am,"
much like a VID/PID in USB or PCI.

Then the driver's of_match table says "if a device claims to
be compatible with any of these it should be bound to me."

Meanwhile, the MFD device method has the device (cell) saying
"I should be bound to the driver having this name."

What the comment meant to say is "we have no need to kzalloc()
any special structure here" as most drivers do. Simply adding
the set of MFDs defined by the cells is enough.  The same is
true in "simple-mfd-i2c.c".

But this entire source file is gone now, so it's moot for that
reason.

OK now I see what you you're talking about.  But these
compatible strings (and data) are for the PMIC.  I was
trying to avoid using compatible strings for the *regulators*,
based on Krzysztof's comment.  And in the process I learned
that the MFD cell needs to specify the name of a driver,
not a compatible string.

Yes, and I agree with that rule.  Thanks for your clarifications.

Using simple-mfd-i2c.c is much better.  I was surprised (and I guess
pleased) to see that it was almost *identical* to what I came up with.
