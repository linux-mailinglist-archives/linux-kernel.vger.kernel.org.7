Yeah that's whats normally done in Rust anyways. But I think that
lifetimes bite us in this case:

    let debugfs: Dir<'static> =3D Dir::new(cstr!("sample_debugfs"));

    let sub: Dir<'a> =3D debugfs.subdir(cstr!("subdir"));
    // lifetime `'a` starts in the line above and `sub` borrows `debugfs`

    /* code for creating the file etc */

    Ok(Self { _debugfs: debugfs, _sub: sub })
    // lifetime `'a` has to end in the line above, since debugfs is moved b=
ut `sub` still borrows from it!

This code won't compile, since we can't store the "root" dir in the same
struct that we want to store the subdir, because the subdir borrows from
the root dir.

Essentially this would require self-referential structs like the
`ouroboros` crate [1] from user-space Rust. We should rather have the
`.keep()` function in the API than use self-referential structs.

[1]: https://docs.rs/ouroboros/latest/ouroboros/attr.self_referencing.html

Another problem that only affects complicated debugfs structures is that
you would have to store all subdirs & files somewhere. If the structure
is dynamic and changes over the lifetime of the driver, then you'll need
a `Vec` or store the dirs in `Arc` or similar, leading to extra
allocations.

I agree with this, I want that `ManuallyDrop` & `forget` are only used
rarely mostly for low-level operations.
