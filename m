Yeah, I just wanted to keep the original behavior to save the used
binaries in the build-ID cache.  But we can use debuginfod if it's
available as you said.

I think it's a separate topic whether we prefer the build-ID cache or
debuginfod.  We should be able to change the default behavior with a
config option later.  So let's keep the caching for now.
