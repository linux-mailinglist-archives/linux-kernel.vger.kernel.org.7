There's no need for anything special... Fo ARM64 and RISC-V, if their
head "code" is actually just structured data, that *also* belongs in a
data section.

And that can get changed if/when they get objtool support.  If not
before.

Hm?  Objtool can handle "non-regular" functions fine.  That's what the
unwind hints are for.  x86 has that already and it works fine.

What *actually* causes problems for objtool (and the whole point of this
discussion) is the placing of data in a text section.  I don't
understand why we're still arguing about whether that's the right thing
to do.  Not to mention the fact that using objtool as an excuse *not* to
do it seems completely backwards!

Unwinding can easily (and often does) happen during boot, before init
memory is freed.

It could even happen in the head code, e.g. in a debugger.  (whether
that actually works might be a different story.)

But also, keep in mind that objtool has many other features beyond just
ORC generation.  In the future it would be quite foreseeable for some
other objtool feature to get confused by this "code" again and spit out
more warnings.

Similarly, if loongarch eventually switches to using sframe, and the
binutils assembler learns how to autogenerate sframe with minimal cfi
directives (a planned feature I believe), it would have the same problem
trying to decipher this "code".

I'm not convinced of that.  I don't think we want to ignore it on x86.
