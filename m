I am not objecting this. And adding your suggestion at the end of the 
mail should make things, well, not pretty but working.

Yes, I agree. It should have changed the reset target from the day 1, 
but as I didn't do it right back then ... We now may very well have it 
somewhere it shouldn't be, and changing this is somewhat risky.

This should keep the existing users happy while also supporting your use 
case. Together with fix to the description of the 
rohm,reset-snvs-powered (as you suggest above), this should work even if 
it's not really pretty. I am not sure how the DT folks see this though.

Another option is to change the rohm,reset-snvs-powered to have a value. 
Something like:
rohm,reset-snvs-powered = "default"; or
rohm,reset-snvs-powered = "forced";

Probably yes.
