Linus,

[
  Note, this has a small merge conflict with include/trace/events/tcp.h
  which should have:

 -DECLARE_TRACE(tcp_cwnd_reduction_tp,
 +DECLARE_TRACE(tcp_cwnd_reduction,

 As this series makes DECLARE_TRACE() always add the "_tp" suffix.
]

tracing updates for v6.16:

- Have module addresses get updated in the persistent ring buffer

  The addresses of the modules from the previous boot are saved in the
  persistent ring buffer. If the same modules are loaded and an address is
  in the old buffer points to an address that was both saved in the
  persistent ring buffer and is loaded in memory, shift the address to point
  to the address that is loaded in memory in the trace event.

- Print function names for irqs off and preempt off callsites

  When ignoring the print fmt of a trace event and just printing the fields
  directly, have the fields for preempt off and irqs off events still show
  the function name (via kallsyms) instead of just showing the raw address.

- Clean ups of the histogram code

  The histogram functions saved over 800 bytes on the stack to process
  events as they come in. Instead, create per-cpu buffers that can hold this
  information and have a separate location for each context level (thread,
  softirq, IRQ and NMI).

  Also add some more comments to the code.

- Add "common_comm" field for histograms

  Add "common_comm" that uses the current->comm as a field in an event
  histogram and acts like any of the other fields of the event.

- Show "subops" in the enabled_functions file

  When the function graph infrastructure is used, a subsystem has a "subops"
  that it attaches its callback function to. Instead of the
  enabled_functions just showing a function calling the function that calls
  the subops functions, also show the subops functions that will get called
  for that function too.

- Add "copy_trace_marker" option to instances

  There are cases where an instance is created for tooling to write into,
  but the old tooling has the top level instance hardcoded into the
  application. New tools want to consume the data from an instance and not
  the top level buffer. By adding a copy_trace_marker option, whenever the
  top instance trace_marker is written into, a copy of it is also written
  into the instance with this option set. This allows new tools to read what
  old tools are writing into the top buffer.

  If this option is cleared by the top instance, then what is written into
  the trace_marker is not written into the top instance. This is a way to
  redirect the trace_marker writes into another instance.

- Have tracepoints created by DECLARE_TRACE() use trace_<name>_tp()

  If a tracepoint is created by DECLARE_TRACE() instead of TRACE_EVENT(),
  then it will not be exposed via tracefs. Currently there's no way to
  differentiate in the kernel the tracepoint functions between those that
  are exposed via tracefs or not. A calling convention has been made
  manually to append a "_tp" prefix for events created by DECLARE_TRACE().
  Instead of doing this manually, force it so that all DECLARE_TRACE()
  events have this notation.

- Use __string() for task->comm in some sched events

  Instead of hardcoding the comm to be TASK_COMM_LEN in some of the
  scheduler events use __string() which makes it dynamic. Note, if these
  events are parsed by user space it they may break, and the event may have
  to be converted back to the hardcoded size.

- Have function graph "depth" be unsigned to the user

  Internally to the kernel, the "depth" field of the function graph event is
  signed due to -1 being used for end of boundary. What actually gets
  recorded in the event itself is zero or positive. Reflect this to user
  space by showing "depth" as unsigned int and be consistent across all
  events.

- Allow an arbitrary long CPU string to osnoise_cpus_write()

  The filtering of which CPUs to write to can exceed 256 bytes. If a machine
  has 256 CPUs, and the filter is to filter every other CPU, the write would
  take a string larger than 256 bytes. Instead of using a fixed size buffer
  on the stack that is 256 bytes, allocate it to handle what is passed in.

- Stop having ftrace check the per-cpu data "disabled" flag

  The "disabled" flag in the data structure passed to most ftrace functions
  is checked to know if tracing has been disabled or not. This flag was
  added back in 2008 before the ring buffer had its own way to disable
  tracing. The "disable" flag is now not always set when needed, and the
  ring buffer flag should be used in all locations where the disabled is
  needed. Since the "disable" flag is redundant and incorrect, stop using it.
  Fix up some locations that use the "disable" flag to use the ring buffer
  info.

- Use a new tracer_tracing_disable/enable() instead of data->disable flag

  There's a few cases that set the data->disable flag to stop tracing, but
  this flag is not consistently used. It is also an on/off switch where if a
  function set it and calls another function that sets it, the called
  function may incorrectly enable it.

  Use a new trace_tracing_disable() and tracer_tracing_enable() that uses a
  counter and can be nested. These use the ring buffer flags which are
  always checked making the disabling more consistent.

- Save the trace clock in the persistent ring buffer

  Save what clock was used for tracing in the persistent ring buffer and set
  it back to that clock after a reboot.

- Remove unused reference to a per CPU data pointer in mmiotrace functions

- Remove unused buffer_page field from trace_array_cpu structure

- Remove more strncpy() instances

- Other minor clean ups and fixes
