Just a generic user-interface comment: I had to look up what 'latency' 
means in this context, and went about 3 hops deep into various pieces 
of description until I found Documentation/cpu-and-latency-overheads.txt,
where after a bit of head-scratching I realized that 'latency' is a
weird alias for 'wall-clock time'...

This is *highly* confusing terminology IMHO.

'Latency' is a highly overloaded concept that almost never corresponds 
to 'wall clock time'. It usually means a relative delay value, which is 
why I initially thought this somehow means instruction-latency or 
memory-latency profiling ...

Ie. 'latency' in its naive meaning, is on the exact opposite side of 
the terminology spectrum of where it should be: it suggests relative 
time, while in reality it's connected to wall-clock/absolute time ...

*Please* use something else. Wall-clock is fine, as 
cpu-and-latency-overheads.txt uses initially, but so would be other 
combinations:

   #1: 'CPU time' vs. 'real time'

        This is short, although a disadvantage is the possible 
        'real-time kernel' source of confusion here.

   #2: 'CPU time' vs. 'wall-clock time'

        This is longer but OK and unambiguous.

   #3: 'relative time' vs. 'absolute time'

        This is short and straightforward, and might be my favorite 
        personally, because relative/absolute is such an unambiguous 
        and well-known terminology and often paired in a similar 
        fashion.

   #4: 'CPU time' vs. 'absolute time'

        This is a combination of #1 and #3 that keeps the 'CPU time' 
        terminology for relative time. The CPU/absolute pairing is not 
        that intuitive though.

   #5: 'CPU time' vs. 'latency'

        This is really, really bad and unintuitive. Sorry to be so 
        harsh and negative about this choice, but this is such a nice 
        feature, which suffers from confusing naming. :-)

Thanks,

	Ingo
