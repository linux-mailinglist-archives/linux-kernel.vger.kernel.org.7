This one will be removed by your patch, right?

I assume this is the condition you remove and

>>> - Check whether util_est > util_avg

this is:

 4918 /*
 4919  * Reset EWMA on utilization increases, the moving average is used
 4920  * to smooth utilization decreases.
 4921  */
 4922  if (ewma <= dequeued) {
 4923      ewma = dequeued;
 4924      goto done;
 4925  }

which is before the condition you remove?

So maybe explain those conditions and their order more carefully? So
it's easier to grasp.

Maybe mentioning 'util_avg eq. dequeued' and 'util_est eq. ewma' would
help here for easier understanding.

Some of the 'stress-ng --class scheduler' seem to be be sensitive in
this regard. Haven't looked deeper into this.
