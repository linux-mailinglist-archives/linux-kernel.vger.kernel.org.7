+AMD SKINIT Interface
+====================
+
+This DRTM comes in two flavours: with DRTM service running in PSP/ASP and
+without one. The DRTM service effectively extends basic functionality of the
+SKINIT instruction providing stronger security guarantees at the cost of more
+complicated programming interface.
+
+As of the end of 2024 the DRTM service is available on Milan/Genoa platforms
+running suitable firmware releases. When firmware doesn't provide the service,
+simpler DRTM process is used.
+
+Basic SKINIT DRTM workflow is straightforward in its design. It defines only
+the bare minimum necessary to perform the DRTM and to pass some data from pre-
+to post-launch code. DRTM service extends the workflow by adding more metadata
+and performing some of the operations itself instead of leaving their
+implementation to a user-provided code (Secure Loader or SL).
+
+Secure Loader image is a binary to which SKINIT instruction passes control. The
+binary must start with a short header defined in the second volume of AMD64
+Architecture Programmer's Manual to have only two required fields. DRTM
+integration guide [4]_ adds an extended header which is mostly opaque and can be
+treated as reserved area in the kernel. Together these fields can be presented
+as the following structure::
+
+        struct sl_header {
+                u16 entry_point;
+                u16 image_size;
+                grub_uint8_t reserved[62];
+                /*
+                 * Any other fields, if present, are implementation-specific.
+                 */
+        } __packed;
+
+Secure Loader is loaded into Secure Loader Block (SLB) which is a 64 KiB area of
+RAM below 4 GiB that starts on a 64 KiB boundary. The smaller a particular SL
+image is, the more space is available for passing additional data which is to
+be placed after the image so it doesn't get measured by SKINIT.
+
+Passing of the information from bootloader to the kernel is carried out by the
+SLRT which is placed after the end of Secure Loader. A platform-specific entry
+of the SLRT is additionally linked as `setup_data` structure allowing the
+kernel to discover location of the SLRT by traversing boot parameters looking
+for the entry.
