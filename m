Yup, and its too late to change.

It's the same user-space. Users of resctrl should be portable between architectures.
Resctrl isn't the only user, of the cache-id field.

libvirt: https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/master/src/util/virresctrl.c#L1588

Sure, but I've not found a project where that is broken yet.

The whole multi-year effort has been to make existing user-space work without any ABI
changes. The effect is some platforms have features that can't be used because resctrl
expects things to be Xeon shaped.
But if your platform looks a bit like a Xeon (cache portion controls on the L3, memory
bandwidth controls somewhere that is believably the L3), then resctrl works as it does on
Intel. The only thing that has come a little unstuck is the 'num_rmid' property where MPAM
doesn't have an equivalent, so '1' is exposed as a safe value.

Remap them in a more complicated way. Chances are there aren't 2^32 CPUs.


I'll add something about the libvirt example to the commit message.


Thanks,

James
