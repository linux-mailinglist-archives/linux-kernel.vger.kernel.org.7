Exactly.

Yeah.

:-/ This is one of the reasons why bugs have such long latencies here.

For example it appears nobody has run kdump on SEV-SNP since last 
August:

  d2062cc1b1c3 x86/sev: Do not touch VMSA pages during SNP guest memory kdump

  ...
    It then results in unrecoverable #NPF/RMP faults as the VMSA page is
    marked busy/in-use when the vCPU is running and subsequently a causes
    guest softlockup/hang.
  ...

Yet lack of testability of your SEV-SNP series is still somehow 
blocking ongoing development work.

You are being exceedingly generous here, but obviously boot code 
changes need quite a bit of testing, and v6.17 (or later) is perfectly 
fine too.

We could perhaps do the mechanical code movement to 
arch/x86/boot/startup/ alone, without any of the followup functional 
changes. This would reduce the cross section of the riskiest part of 
your series substantially. If that sounds good to you, please send a 
series for review.

Thanks,
