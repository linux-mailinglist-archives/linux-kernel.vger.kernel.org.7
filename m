Yeah that could be the culprit.
Peter's fix [1] landed on next recently, I guess in a couple of days you'll=
 get it on the upstream tree and you may not see the problem.

Nevertheless, I didn't check exactly what --cpu-sched does, but I'm expecti=
ng it to do any wild thing to stress the scheduler, so it may be normal to =
have more errors than, say, --cyclic, which only runs nanosleeps.

Great, that's exactly what I wanted to know, thanks.

Mmh I guessed something like that, although numbers were a bit out of propo=
rtion (e.g. 500 page-faults and 8 errors), but again, I didn't check too ca=
refully what happens under the hood.

That's a good point, also I didn't mention I was running these tests in a V=
M (virtme-ng), so the system stress is minimal and perhaps the setup trigge=
rs some different oddities (filesystems are overlays and some other things =
are set up differently from a real system).

Thank you for the tips!
