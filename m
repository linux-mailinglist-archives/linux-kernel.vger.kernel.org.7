Mmm, I actually don't have the answer to this. Ramoops carveout
handling was added to t186 and t194 in cboot for L4T r32.7.3, fairly
late in the life cycle. But it has always been in edk2 for t194 and
t234 afaik. I could hazard some guesses, but don't have any
documentation on why the decision was made. Maybe Thierry or Jonathan
could chime in on why this was done.
