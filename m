Thank you for being kind and flexible about the decision.  One such use case I
can think off the top of my head is when users want to do memory tiering, and
there are multiple nodes of same tier.  For example, if users want to migrate
hot pages in a node to the upper tier, and there are multiple nodes for the
tier, users may want to do the migration with same weight, or in proportion to
their free space.

So let's push this way for now.  Nothing is set on the stone, so please feel
free to let me know if you feel differently later.

This is correct.

This is how an early version of DAMON sysfs interface was working.  Your
concern was true for the version.  Hence, we implemented online tuning
feature[1].  If you use DAMON user-space tool, 'damo tune'[2] is the command
for using this feature.  So, as long as you use the feature, updating weights
several times per minute shouldn't make such issues.

Thank you for asking.  Please feel free to ask any more questions as you need!

Great.  I will try to do this by this weekend.

The pleasure if mine!
