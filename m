Thanks for explaining this so well and the code pointer!

Yeah it doesnt seem reasonable to change the size of pageblock_flags at runtime.

I saw you mentioned of a proposal to decouple pageblock order from defrag granularity
in one of the other replies as well, just wanted to check if there was anything you had
sent in lore in terms of proposal or RFC that I could look at.

So I guess the question is what should be the next step? The following has been discussed:

- Changing pageblock_order at runtime: This seems unreasonable after Zi's explanation above
  and might have unintended consequences if done at runtime, so a no go?
- Decouple only watermark calculation and defrag granularity from pageblock order (also from Zi).
  The decoupling can be done separately. Watermark calculation can be decoupled using the
  approach taken in this RFC. Although max order used by pagecache needs to be addressed.
