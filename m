The building blocks are there. You can iterate over nodes with 'phys' 
with for_each_node_with_property(), then on each entry in 'phys' check 
if it matches your node. Then you need to iterate over the ports to 
check for connection to usb-c-connector. 
of_graph_get_remote_port_parent() will help you there. Not terribly 
efficient, but you're only doing it once.

Another option is extend phy modes to distinguish USB-C or not. Then you 
can set the mode either with the 'phy-mode' property or in phy cells. 
Though if you have to add a cell, that's an ABI change (not sure if the 
existing kernel would accept another cell).

I rather see the kernel use the information that's already there rather 
than have 2 sources of information.
