I mean, if I write a driver and I store a Rust object that holds a
debugfs directory in some random struct of mine, how is debugfs going to
go remove it from my struct? It can't.

At most we could enforce that you destroy them in the right order, but
actually designing an API which enforces that is difficult and results
in something inconvenient to use.

Of course, drivers probably shouldn't keep those ghost objects around,
but I don't think the API should hard enforce that.
