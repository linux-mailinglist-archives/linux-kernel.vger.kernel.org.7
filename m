I was thinking about making the MDIO bus a separate device. But I think
it will be tricky to get suspend/resume working correctly. And this
makes conversions more difficult because you cannot just add some
pcs_get/pcs_put calls, you have to split out the MDIO bus too (which is
invariably created as a child of the MAC).

And what happens if a developer doesn't realize they have to split off
the MDIO bus before converting? Everything works fine, except if there
is some problem loading the PCS driver, which they may not test. Is this
prohibition against failing after creating a bus documented anywhere? I
don't recall seeing it...

See [1]. Devicetree is not upstream yet (working on it...) but it looks
like

&gem0 {
	pcs-handle = <&pcs0>;
	post-init-providers = <&pcs0>;
	sfp = <&sfp0>;
	managed = "in-band-status";
	phy-mode = "1000base-x";
	nvmem-cells = <&eth_address 0>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "mac-address";
	/delete-property/ phy-handle;

	mdio {
		pcs0: ethernet-pcs@0 {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "xlnx,pcs-16.2", "xlnx,pcs";
			reg = <0>;
			clocks = <&si570>;
			clock-names = "refclk";
			interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 106 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "an";
			reset-gpios = <&axi_gpio_2 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			done-gpios = <&axi_gpio_3 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			xlnx,pcs-modes = "sgmii", "1000base-x";
		};
	};
};

or in another instance

&eth_0_eth_buf {
	clocks = <&zynqmp_clk PL0_REF>;
	clock-names = "s_axi_lite_clk";
	pcs-handle = <&pcs4>;
	managed = "in-band-status";
	phy-handle = <&phy5>;
	phy-mode = "sgmii";
	post-init-providers = <&pcs4>, <&phy5>;
	nvmem-cells = <&eth_address 4>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "mac-address";
	iommus = <&smmu 0x200>, <&smmu 0x240>, <&smmu 0x248>;
	/delete-property/ local-mac-address;
	/delete-property/ xlnx,phy-type;

	mdio {
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 38 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		reset-delay-us = <10000>;
		reset-post-delay-us = <50000>;

		pcs4: ethernet-pcs@1 {
			#reset-cells = <1>;
			compatible = "xlnx,pcs-16.2", "xlnx,pcs";
			reg = <1>;
			clocks = <&vc5 4>;
			clock-names = "refclk";
			assigned-clocks = <&vc5 4>;
			assigned-clock-rates = <125000000>;
			reset-gpios = <&axi_gpio_2 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			xlnx,pcs-modes = "sgmii";
		};

		phy2: ethernet-phy@2 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <2>;
			interrupts-extended = <&gpio 118 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		};

		phy4: ethernet-phy@4 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <4>;
			interrupts-extended = <&gpio 119 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		};

		phy5: ethernet-phy@5 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <5>;
			interrupts-extended = <&gpio 117 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		};

		phy6: ethernet-phy@6 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			reg = <6>;
			interrupts-extended = <&gpio 120 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		};
	};
};

In the second case, the phy also has the same relationship, but it is
not an issue since the phy is looked up in ndo_open instead of
phylink_create.

The ZCU102/106 supports this, but the in-tree devicetree only has hard
IP as opposed to things done in the FPGA. However, the "default"
configuration for xilinx_axienet assumes that the PCS is on the MAC's
MDIO bus [2].
