I don't see why we would want to do that. I can see why we would want to keep a
Vec of some "payload" structure, e.g. some Client structure. But even then,
using a simple resizable array is rarely a good choice.

IMHO there is just no point in optimizing for this case.

If there is anything specific you have in mind, it would be good to share what
that is.

In drivers we have per device allocations, e.g. the driver's private data, the
private data of a class device registration, the private data of a work items,
the private data if an IRQ, etc.

And for cases where we create instances of some struct dynamically, we usually
just go with a new allocation for each new instance and store it in lists, tree
structures, XArray, etc.

Especially, if there can be lots of instances of the same structure, you don't
want to re-allocate all the time and copy things around, but use a kmem_cache
instead.

I don't agree with that -- forcing a reference count for something that doesn't
need to be reference counted is clearly more "noise" that a few trivial
changes, such as:

- foo: Foo,
+ foo: debugfs::File<Foo>,

I understand that -- and thanks for your work on this, I really appreciate it!

Regarding the question: Yes, I'm clearly all for A, I don't think there's much
value in B.
