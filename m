I just had another conversation about this internally, and there is another
concern; we obviously don't want to modify the pgtables while other CPUs that
don't support BBML2 could be accessing them. Even in stop_machine() this may be
possible if the CPU stacks and task structure (for example) are allocated out of
the linear map.

So we need to be careful to follow the pattern used by kpti; all secondary CPUs
need to switch to the idmap (which is installed in TTBR0) then install the
reserved map in TTBR1, then wait for CPU 0 to repaint the linear map, then have
the secondary CPUs switch TTBR1 back to swapper then switch back out of idmap.

Given CPU 0 supports BBML2, I think it can just update the linear map live,
without needing to do the idmap dance?

Ryan
