The original compact unwind information implementation was designed in
2009, before
shrink wrapping was implemented in LLVM in 2015. It is definitely not
fully asynchronous
as it lacks information about the epilogue. When unwinding in the
middle of the prologue,
one can recover partial information leveraging the prologue codegen
pattern, probably good enough to recover
SP in the absence of shrink wrapping.

While there are limitations, it does not mean we cannot yield useful
data from it.

In a x86-64 build of clang-21, there is one single CIE and 141845 FDEs.
The average size of a FDE is: (0x733348 - 0x18) / 141845 ~=3D 52.225
(0x18 is the first FDE offset in llvm-dwarfdump -eh-frame output).

Considering .eh_frame_hdr entry, per-function size is around 52.225+8 =3D 6=
0.225.

The .sframe V2 per-function size is 0x820820 / 141845 ~=3D 60.078.

On LLVM Discourse we are discussing the next generation of compact
unwind information,
which will support at least asynchronous stack tracing (the SFrame
feature subset) and synchronous C++ exceptions.
We aim to provide a per-entry size of 12 bytes.
The average number of entries per function is likely between 1 and 2,
making the scheme very size-efficient even without utilizing page
table deduplication.

Asynchronous as far as the compiler-generated patterns are concerned.
Compilers do exhibit the patterns and we should utilize them, aiming
for a compact format.
We are trying to lift the restriction as much as possible when
designing the new format.

This stance puts SFrame in a very narrow niche.
Per-function unwind info of 120 bytes (EH+SFrame: 60+60) far exceeds the si=
ze
the next-generation compact unwind information aims to achieve (likely
<24 bytes even without using a page table).

I believe the potential of the next-generation compact unwind
information is clear. For this reason, I urge performance maintainers
not to rush the integration of sframe v3 support.
If these architectural design issues of SFrame aren't resolved
beforehand, we risk launching a format that very few people will
actually use.

A hypothetical s390x implementation of the compact unwind information
can reserve 1 bit (in the mode-specific-encoding, or "opcodes" in
https://faultlore.com/blah/compact-unwinding/ ) to indicate whether
the RA is saved in a stack slot or a register.
