Completely agree on this, but could find an appropriate Documentation/
file listing arm64 platform relate debugfs interfaces. Just wondering
if we need to have such a file created in Documentation/arch/arm64 ?

Hmm, alright. I tried to reason about what is being done in the kernel
but as you mentioned above, user visible effects were not very clearly
apparent. But having a kernel command line option without documenting
on what it really does seemed problematic as well.

Right, it is an system wide override regardless whether there are any
current users for these break/watch points.

ARM ARM DDI 0487 L.A states that EDSCR.HDE can be used to enable/disable
debug halting with OSLSR_EL1.OSLK = 1. Hence MDSCR_EL1.{MDE,KDE} controls
are not required to disable debug state in kernel.

But that would be a bug in the HW, not an expected behaviour - is not it ?

Yes, we could probably remove both 'nodebugmon' kernel command line option
and 'debug_enabled' debug fs control if EDSCR.HDE is the controller of the
debug state for external debuggers.
