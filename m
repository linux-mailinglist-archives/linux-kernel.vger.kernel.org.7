OK, I can do this with `.keep()` just being equivalent to
`ManuallyDrop::new`. Since we now only have "by default, things are
dropped", rather than two states, we shouldn't need a `.destroy()`
method.

Just to ensure I understand correctly, your opinion is that on
balance, additional complexity in the API types are worth making it
less ergonomic to suppress drop on a root directory, keeping in mind
that they still *can* suppress drop on that directory. You don't want
the extra API variants to do anything else special other than change
the ergonomics of `.keep()` (e.g. don't have subdirectories be default
pre-`.keep()`'d).

We can't easily do this, because dropping a root directory recursively
drops everything underneath it. This means that if I have

foo/
  - bar/
  - baz/

Then my directory handle for `bar` have to be guaranteed to outlive my
directory handle for `foo` so that I know it's didn't get deleted
under me. This is why they have a borrow onto their parent directory.
This borrow means that you can't (without `unsafe`, or something like
`yoke`) keep handles to `foo` and `bar` in the same struct.

I could arguably make the subdir handle creator *take ownership* of
the root handle, which would mitigate this issue, but if we want to
allow creation of arbitrarily shaped trees, we'd either end up rapidly
reproducing something like my builder interface from the follow-up
series which I understand folks aren't enthused about, or we'd end up
with Rust having a mirror struct of some kind, e.g.

```
struct Tree {
  name: CString,
  // Order is load bearing, any children must be dropped before their paren=
t
  children: KVec<Tree>
  root: Dir,
}

impl Tree {
  fn subdir(&mut self, name: &CStr) -> &mut Tree {
    if let Some(x) =3D children.iter_mut().find(|tree| tree.name =3D=3D nam=
e) {
      x
    } else {
      // This is an internal function, similar to Dir::create
      // SAFETY: The structure promises all children will be released
before the parent directory is destroyed.
      self.children.push(unsafe { Tree::sys_subdir(self.dir, name) })
      self.children.last_mut().unwrap()
    }
}
```

This structure has the downside that we now need to track the file
structure in Rust too, not just in the main kernel. This gets more
complex when we add Files, but follows the same approximate structure.

If we don't track the filenames, you have no way to reference
subdirectories again later. If we do track them, we're reproducing
dentry structure less efficiently in Rust. Additionally, because this
needs to track filenames, this now means that `CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=3Dn` is
no longer free.
