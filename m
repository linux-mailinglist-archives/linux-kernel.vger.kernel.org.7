But it's not how the things work. Once there's an API anyone can use it,
right?

How do you intend to restrict this API usage to subsystems that are related
to the live update flow? Or userspace driving ioctls outside "liveupdated"
user agent?

There are a lot of examples of kernel subsystems that were designed for a
particular thing and later were extended to support additional use cases.

I'm not saying LUO should "anticipate some other random states", what I'm
saying is that usecases other than liveupdate may appear and use the APIs
LUO provides for something else.

If we make LUO the only uABI to drive KHO it becomes misnamed from the
start.
As you mentioned yourself, reserve_mem and potentially IMA and kexec
telemetry are not necessarily related to LUO, but it still would be useful
to support them without LUO.

While it's easy to make memblock a LUO subsystem to me it seems
semantically wrong naming.

pstore can use reserve_mem already.

Right, but we still need something to drive kho_mem_serialize().
And it has to be done before kexec load, at least until we resolve this.

Currently this is triggered either by KHO debugfs or by LUO ioctls. If we
completely drop KHO debugfs and notifiers, we still need something that
would trigger the magic.

I'm not saying we should keep KHO debugfs and notifiers, I'm saying that if
we make LUO the only thing driving KHO, liveupdate is not an appropriate
name.
