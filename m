Yes, indeed - I wrote that initial reply before I saw the actual change.
I wasn't expecting a conflict but rather that what'd happened was that
the bit was allocated independently in two different trees and then due
to the way the allocations are scattered everywhere no conflict had
flagged the issue.

Putting all the flags somewhere in the vicinity of each other would make
the whole thing much more robust, or having some build assert for
uniqueness.

I think we need something here, although it wasn't what actually
happened here the potential for the scenario I mentioned above to occur
remains.
