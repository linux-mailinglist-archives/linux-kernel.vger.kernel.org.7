 FWIW I can't agree more here.

 Why would these have to be disabled if we have CMPXCHG8B emulation?  Yes,
performance won't be stellar, but we talked it through already in the 
context of my recent EV4 Alpha effort.  People ran FPU emulation back in 
the day too rather than using soft-float, which would have surely reduced 
the handling overhead.

 Conversely dropping support for a subtarget in the kernel will likely 
prompt the removal on the userland side, namely glibc, which will only 
complicate things.

 This is a fair point, although I'm not sure why the bots are expected to 
complain about a piece of code once it's settled and does not change.  I 
can't recall any mailing list traffic about MIPS instruction emulation for 
legacy systems (and we made it a part of the uABI even) in what? -- 20 
years or so.

 And I'd prefer to stay away from hacks even at the cost of performance.  
I don't find the emulation of CMPXCHG8B and maybe RDTSC if really needed 
(possibly in a trivial way, such as returning an incrementing software 
counter) a hack, but evolution.  It has happened before.

 FWIW I'm fine to see FPU emulation code go, especially as it's something 
that can be sorted in the userland for the so inclined.  Or you can run a 
soft-float userland, for example in the form of a GCC multilib just as 
done with numerous targets.
