I find it helpful to grep around for similar things:

hp2:/usr/src/25> egrep -rl "hung_task_detect_count|warn_count|oops_count" Documentation                    
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-kernel-warn_count
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-kernel-oops_count
Documentation/admin-guide/sysctl/kernel.rst

I'm not sure that we've been very complete/consistent in these things. 
If you have time, please check that we've covered these things
appropriately.

That's all great stuff, thanks.  Please include it in the [0/N]?

um, well, Kees, sorry, that wasn't a world class effort.
