Like you suggested, I decided to run a simulation just to see if the number
of nodes allocated from each page lined up with the old version, and if the
numbers made sense for both cases. I found a few issues with my version of the
code:

The math is just incorrect when rounds == 0. Let's say there's a 2-node machine
with weights [10, 7]. We should start allocating from node0 with 7 remaining
pages, and we want to allocate 14 pages. Here's how the new math goes:

- First node should allocate 7 pages, let carryover = 7
- Then remaining pages = 14 - 7 = 7
- Allocate rounds * weight + min(weight, delta) + carryover:
    = 0 * 10 + min(10, 7) + 7
    = 7 + 7
    = 14

This is incorrect, since we will be allocating all 14 pages from the first
node, and the real distribution should be 7 pages from the first node, and
7 pages from the second node. I think this can also lead to some overallocation
issues.

So there are a few options now:
- Change the addition to be:
        rounds * weight + min(min(weight, delta + carryover), weight)
  and adjust the remaining math accordingly. But this looks very bad and
  is not intuitive at all, so I don't like this idea. 
- This can easily be solved, if instead of figuring out how many pages have to
  be allocated as we iterate through the nodes, we do one pass and figure out
  how many pages must be allocated. The problem here is that we re-introduce
  another loop, which adds to the code complexity and may actually be a
  performance decrease instead. So again, I don't think this is the best idea.
- Skip this patch! This is a small optimization on performance, and I think it
  simplifies the code, but turns out the original math to do is just much harder
  without doing two separate calculations. I'll keep this running in the back
  of my mind to see if I can figure out a way to solve it later...

I also think it makes sense to drop the first patch as well, since there's no
optimization included with the cleanup. But since it already got a few reviews,
maybe it makes to keep that one : -)

Anyways, I really appreciate the review Gregory! Maybe I'll have a brekathrough
idea on how to correctly do the math here sometime in the future.

Have a great day!
Joshua
