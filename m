Dont really understand this...a high-privileged supervisor agent would
anyway send a suspend/shutdown request to the SCMI server which in turn
should be able to filter out such spurious requests...or such suspend
request from the supervisor to the agent comes through other non-SCMI
means ?

An agent is NOT capable to send direct notification to another agent...
....notifcation are sent via the P2A channels which means that the server is
in charge to send notifs...other agents can cause notifs to be sent NOT
send them directly...so that the server can filter-out any hacked
request...

Absolutely, BUT SCMI is a client/server system and the server is in
charge to filter-out such requests, since each agent has its own dedicated
channel and it is identified by the server as agent_X with capabilities_X
from the channel it speaks from (i.e. an agent cannot spoof its identify)

...and the server is the ultimate judge/aribter of any request so that
it can drop any unreasonable request...we should NOT delegate such
self-protection mechanisms to the agents...

Yes...another privileged agent request a Reboot for agent_X (SYSPOWER_STATE+_SET)
to the server and the server in turn sends a Reboot notification to the
suspended agent_X , which is woken up by the notification and proceeds
with a graceful shutdown/reboot...if this does NOT happen it is
definitely a bug..

In theory yes, it should work like this, BUT better if the 2nd message
never come (as explained above)...if this happens, I would say log this
as a warning too because it is not a normal scenario...i.e. if you
receive multuple suspend to the same agent from the same server...
...something is wrong...I agree Linux should survive (and suspend back)
BUT should not be allowed at first (filtered-out) 

Thanks,
Cristian
