The original patch is trying to fix a potential issue in which a memory
range is split, while the sub-range split out is always on top of the
entire memory range, hence no risk.

Later, we encountered a UBSAN warning around the above memory range
splitting code several times. We found this patch can mute the warning.

Please see below UBSAN splat trace report from Coiby:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/4de3c2onosr7negqnfhekm4cpbklzmsimgdfv33c52dktqpza5@z5pb34ghz4at/T/#u

Later, Coiby got the root cause from investigation, please see:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/2754f4evjfumjqome63bc3inqb7ozepemejn2lcl57ryio2t6k@35l3tnn73gei/T/#u

Right.

Got it, then Coiby can post a standalone patch to fix commit 15fcedd43a08
("kexec: Annotate struct crash_mem with __counted_by") and CC stable, then
post a new version of this patch on top.

Thanks a lot for confirming.
