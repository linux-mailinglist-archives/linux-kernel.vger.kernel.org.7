There are two differences.  First, xhci-hcd already has its own lock 
that it acquires when enqueuing or dequeuing URBs, so no additional 
locks would be needed.  Second, complicated memory pool management isn't 
necessary; the management can be extremely simple.  (For example, 
Mathias suggested just reusing the most recently released memory area 
unless it is too small.)

Because then getting or releasing memory areas from the pool could be 
carried out just by manipulating a couple of pointers.

Some fraction of the time, URBs are created on demand and destroyed upon 
completion.  Your approach would not save any time for these URBs, 
whereas my suggested approach would.  (This fraction probably isn't very 
large, although I don't know how big it is.)

Those other HC drivers would still require changes.  They could be 
changed to support my scheme as easily as your scheme.

If I were redesigning Linux's entire USB stack from the beginning, I 
would change it so that URBs would be dedicated to particular host 
controllers and endpoint types -- maybe even to particular endpoints.  
They would contain all the additional memory required for the HCD to use 
them, all pre-allocated, so that dynamic allocation would not be needed 
during normal use.  (The gadget subsystem behaves this way already.)

Such a drastic change isn't feasible at this point, although what you 
are suggesting is a step in that direction.  In the end it comes down 
to a time/space tradeoff, and it's very difficult to know what the best 
balance is.

I'm not saying that your approach is bad or wrong, just that there are 
other possibilities to consider.
