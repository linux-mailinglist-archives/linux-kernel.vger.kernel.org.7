Thanks Hugh for your input. (yes, we put in a lot of effort on 
discussion and testing:( ).

Yes, agree. we should not break userspace, however, I suspect whether 
this can really break userspace. We can set 
'/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled' to 'madvise' to allow 
MADV_COLLAPSE. Additionally, I really doubt that when the system-wide 
THP settings are set to 'never', userspace would still expect to 
collapse into THP using MADV_COLLAPSE.

Moreover, what makes this issue particularly frustrating is that when we 
introduce mTHP collapse[1], MADV_COLLAPSE complicates matters further. 
That is, when the system only enables 64K mTHP, MADV_COLLAPSE still 
allows collapsing into PMD-sized THP. This really breaks the user's 
settings.

Yes, that will prevent MADV_COLLAPSE.
