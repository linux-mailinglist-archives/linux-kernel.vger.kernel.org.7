Sure, since it is left to architecture to define what it means, it could
work. But what happens if we have multiple chiplet inside a socket and
each chiplet has multiple cluster. Do you envision using this SCHED_CLUSTER
at chiplet level if that works best on the platform ?

That could work, but we need to document all these with the best of our
knowledge now so that it is easy to revisit in the future.

That is pure wrong. ACPI is describing the hardware. Deciding to put
clustering information in these tables only if it provides performance or
not hinder performance seem complete non-sense to me. That covering policy
in ACPI hardware description. Does ACPI spec mention anything about it ?
I mean remove some hardware description even if it is 100% accurate if it
hinders performance on one of the OSPM ? Doesn't sound correct at all.

Not a bad idea. We can see if allow or blocklist works as we start with one.

Not completely against it but I have concerns on how all these scale with
multiple chiplets within a socket or any such variants.

Sure, but too much flexibility might also hinder future changes when adding
some other feature(chiplet again is one thing I can think of now)

Not sure if that should be right direction TBH, but again not against the
idea of enabling the feature on some platforms if we are going to enable it
by default.

I understand and get the point, but decadelong is bit of an exaggeration ðŸ˜‰.
Not discussing these in ACPI or similar forum is not a good idea as we know
there are new h/w features that are being added and current specification
may not provide ways to express all of those.
