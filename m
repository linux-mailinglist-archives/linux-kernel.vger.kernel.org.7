It is definitely worth adding all the above info and shaming the firmware
for not taking care of this. I still don't like this as PSCI is there
for nearly a decade now and still we see such limitations that needs to
be fixed in the firmware and now workaround in the kernel.

Thanks that's what we need to fully understand the need of otherwise
useless dance around hotplug and idle state machinery in the kernel.
