Hi Namhyung,

The preference for sysfs/json over legacy was done as a bug fix and
because ARM (Mark Rutland) argued strongly that it was the most
sensible priority. Intel (Kan Liang) approved the change in priority.
RISC-V have wanted this behavior as it enables the migration of event
mappings from the driver to the tool. As the primary maintainer of the
event parsing and metric code I prefer the priority as legacy events
are weird, for example they aren't case insensitive in their naming.
For example, on Intel with legacy events as the priority cpu-cycles
would be a legacy event, but cpu-Cyles a sysfs one. On ARM cpu_cycles
would be a sysfs event, but cpu-cycles a legacy one. A minor character
difference and very different and imo surprising event encodings.

On your RFC thread Arnaldo and James said that legacy events somehow
enabled a form of drill down. As event parsing is mapping a name to a
perf_event_attr I completely don't see this as the mapping is opaque.

I strongly believe we need consistency. If `perf stat -e cycles .. `
prints cpu_core/cycles/ as the event name on a hybrid Intel, then
`perf stat -e cpu_core/cycles/ .. ` should have the same
perf_event_attr. Both patch series achieve this but this one does it
with consistency, and from what I see it, the support of 3 vendors.

Thanks,
Ian
