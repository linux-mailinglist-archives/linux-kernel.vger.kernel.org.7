I'm not sure freezing/frozen distinction is that meaningful. If each cgroup
tracks total durations for both states, most threads should be able to rely
on freezing duration delta, right? There shouldn't be significant time gap
between freezing starting and most threads being frozen although the cgroup
may not reach full frozen state due to e.g. NFS and what not.

As long as threads are not migrated across cgroups, it should be able to do
something like:

1. Read /proc/self/cgroup to determine the current cgroup.
2. Read and remember freezing duration $CGRP/cgroup.stat.
3. Do time taking operation.
4. Read $CGRP/cgrp.stat and calculate delta and deduct that from time taken.

Would that work?

Thanks.
