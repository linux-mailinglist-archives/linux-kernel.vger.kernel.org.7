Hi, Chris Li 

Thank you for your thoughtful and quick feedback.

Let me clarify my concern with a concrete example.
Suppose:
1. SSD → tier "A" (31–40), HDD → "B" (21–30), HDD2 → "C" (10–20), HDD3 → "D" (0–9)
2. A cgroup uses tier "A"
3. SSD is swapped off → tier "A" becomes a hole
4. Tier "D" is removed
5. Tier "A" is reassigned to range (0–9)
6. Then a cgroup configured with "A" cannot actually use "A" (0~9)
7. Later a new tier "E" is added and assigned (31–40)
8. A cgroup now configured with "E" refers to the same numeric range (31–40),
   but the meaning has changed compared to when it used "A".

This feels unintuitive. I would prefer invalidating the mask if the referenced
tier is removed, so stale references don’t silently point to a different tier.

Ack. Let’s settle user-visible semantics first and defer allocator internals.
We can revisit per-CPU cluster cache handling as a lower-priority topic when we
move to patchwork.

My understanding is:

Per tier (2-bit state)
- `+` → always on (bit 10)
- `-` → always off (bit 01)
- missing → inherit from parent (bit 00)
- `11` is invalid

Default tier
- `+` means inherit parent as the base
- `-` means start from zero (ignore parent)
- missing means (this is the part I want to confirm) nothing?

So in my view “default” is an **inheritance control knob**, whereas in your
explanation “default” is also a **special tier** with its own 2-bit state.
Is that the right reading?

If my understanding is correct, I’m also happy to adopt the interface format
you proposed.

Over the weekend I kept thinking about it, and your proposal looks like a
more flexible interface. It also has clear similarities to how cgroup
controllers are added, so the format seems acceptable to me.

I have one remaining concern about cgroup semantics.
The inheritance and resource model we’re discussing seems to diverge
somewhat from existing cgroup v2 conventions. Since we’ve aligned that
this effectively acts as QoS control, it also makes me wonder whether we
should proactively propose a doc update to the “Resource Distribution
Models” section so the concept is explicitly covered. This may be me
being overcautious, so I’d appreciate your view.

Ack. Reserving a predefined tier bit for zswap makes sense.

As a passing thought (not a strong proposal): a few common tiers (e.g., zswap,
ssd, hdd, remote) could be predefined and non-removable, with users inserting
custom ranges between or apart from them. For example, if an SSD tier is
predefined, `swapon` for SSD devices could be limited to that tier—this would
align with grouping by service speed and nudge users toward sensible configs.

Ack. I prefer allowing holes, so we don’t need to enforce covering the full
range simply. 
(I had considered usage making full-range coverage coexist with holes, 
but on reflection that doesn’t seem necessary. complicated)

I meant the order implied by the priority ranges. In the interface I suggested,
the `-` operator specifies ordered ranges, so a notion of tier order matters.
With your format this may not be needed or not that important.

When I said “default tier,” I meant a conceptual tier that covers the full
priority range when nothing is specified. From your reply, your “default”
sounds closer to a *default value* (inheritance control) rather than a
standalone tier. Did I get that right?

As discussed above, we’re allowing holes, so we can accept inputs that don’t
cover the full range.

If swapoff is complete but removal has not occurred and a new tier comes in,
we can allow splitting. If a tier reference is still held, splitting should not
be allowed. A corner case: a tier spans 50–100 but only priorities 55 and 60
have active swap; inserting a split at 70 (no active refs) — to keep rules
simple, I’d still **not** accept the split while any references exist anywhere
in the original range.

Ack. One file is simpler; show local then effective. For now, a newline
separator looks clearer than “#”.

I think the format you suggest (+, -)
is appropriate from a flexibility perspective.

Ack.
