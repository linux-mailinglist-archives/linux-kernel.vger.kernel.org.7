I will put to queue with my tags but I just want to make first sure that we do not
break anything.

I'll upgrade my test suite first to have TPM 1.2 tests (which is also
needed for my own series) and run it in bunch of configurations.  And on
TPM2 I check the behavior with TSS2 daemon on / off.

I have no doubts on the code changes, and it is most importantly a
security improvement, given that "who has the access and how long" 
can be deduced for a system configuration. I just feel that with
this code change it is better to check and verify everything :-)

BR, Jarkko
