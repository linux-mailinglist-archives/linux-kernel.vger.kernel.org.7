I'd recommend opening a thread on Zulip before you go implement stuff.
Then you can also get a more rusty name for `fls` :)

When you use a power of 2 constant, then I'm very sure that it will get
optimized [1]. Even with non-powers of 2, you don't get a division [2].
If you find some code that is not optimized, then sure add a custom
function.

That's also fair, but we lose the constness of `next_multiple_of`, so
you can't use `align_up` in a const function. That might confuse people
and then they write their own const helper function... I'd prefer we use
all functions that are available in the stdlib.

Ah right... Then maybe add that to the upstream suggestion :)
