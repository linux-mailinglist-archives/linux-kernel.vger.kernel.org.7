What is _the_ vulnerability? While I do understand that _any_ potential
vulnerability in the removed code is removed as well I still do not see
how the driver removal is related to _this_ specific CVE.

I do understand you do not want to send notifications for that. Would it
make sense to announce a new upstream commit added to the CVE, though? This
would make it much easier to see that we might be missing a fix that is
considered related to a particular CVE.

Nope, not really. Specific stable tree versions affected is not the most
important information to downstreams like ours. We really do care about
specific commits that are coupled with the CVE. If the specific commit
doesn't have Fixes tag then we look a the CVE-$FOO.vulnerable as well
(btw. I have a growing list of those that we have identified breakers
for and I am looking for the best way to contribute that information to
others. I am just not sure how to do that in the most efficient way -
sorry slightly offtopic here - we can follow up off the list.).

We are not parsing mbox files. We do care about CVE-$FOO.sha1 and that
provides the base for our future analysis. If we need to expect several
upstream commits there we are fine with that. Quite honestly seeing a
stream of CVEs all fixing the same vulnerability just because those
fixes happened in many commits doesn't seem to be optimal.
