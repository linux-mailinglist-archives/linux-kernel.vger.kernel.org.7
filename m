My bot found new DTB warnings on the .dts files added or changed in this
series.

Some warnings may be from an existing SoC .dtsi. Or perhaps the warnings
are fixed by another series. Ultimately, it is up to the platform
maintainer whether these warnings are acceptable or not. No need to reply
unless the platform maintainer has comments.

If you already ran DT checks and didn't see these error(s), then
make sure dt-schema is up to date:

  pip3 install dtschema --upgrade


This patch series was applied (using b4) to base:
 Base: attempting to guess base-commit...
 Base: remotes/arm-soc/rockchip/dt64-12-gff7c417e54a8 (exact match)

If this is not the correct base, please add 'base-commit' tag
(or use b4 which does this automatically)
