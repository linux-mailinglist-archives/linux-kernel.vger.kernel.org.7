Some of them only support one mute LED, some of them don't have any mute LED. So, I think that the below codes should be work to handle it. I have verified the below codes on Lenovo Yoga Pro7 14APH8(MachineType 82Y8) which is only support mic mute LED. In fact, I have gotten user mail which describe the same issue on Lenovo Yoga Pro7 14APH8 with https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220271 which reported this issue on MachineType: 81Y3.

It's good suggestion and I have updated the patch and submit it in 
another mail.
