Yes, I agree this should not impact you too much.

I think you would need Dev's series to be able to apply the permissions change
without needing to split the whole range to pte mappings? So I guess your change
must either be implementing something similar to what Dev is working on or you
are splitting the entire range to ptes? If the latter, then I'm not keen on that
approach.

Regarding the linear map repainting, I had a chat with Catalin, and he reminded
me of a potential problem; if you are doing the repainting with the machine
stopped, you can't allocate memory at that point; it's possible a CPU was inside
the allocator when it stopped. And I think you need to allocate intermediate
pgtables, right? Do you have a solution to that problem? I guess one approach
would be to figure out how much memory you will need and pre-allocate prior to
stoping the machine?

That works assuming you have a solution for the above.
