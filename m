Yes, that is what I am referring to, as you all seem to want to do
"complex things without a specific filename choosen".  Look at
Documentation/driver-api/firmware/fallback-mechanisms.rst for the
details there.

Or, better yet, just have your driver name all of the individual files
that must be loaded and then no userspace things are needed.  That "big"
firmware file will have already been split up into the different parts
when you write it out to the filesystem, so no need to parse anything.

If this isn't going to work for some reason, I think we need a better
"this is EXACTLY what we need to send to the hardware for the firmware
image(s) it requires" as I'm totally confused based on the different
people talking on this thread about totally different hypotheticals
(i.e. 12 line elf parsers in C vs. a giant elf parser in rust, random
hypothetical hardware values that userspace "can not know", pointing at
obsolete crazy interfaces like remoteproc that just happen to do crazy
things, etc.)

So step back, come up with a solid design document, and let's start over
please.

thanks,
