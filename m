Docker's default path is on the rootfs. Our rootfs size is typically 70GB,
but we might have 300+ or even 500+ CPUs. This could lead to scalability
issues in certain specific scenarios. However, in general,
sbi->s_groups_count / 4 does appear to be sufficient.

I don't think so. Although we're now splitting into multiple goals, these
goals all start from zero. This means 'n' goals will cause us to scan all
groups 'n' times. We'll repeatedly search for free space on disk rather
than creating more fragmentation.

This approach can actually solve the issue where a single goal, despite
having 4K free space available, causes an 8K allocation request to skip it,
forcing subsequent 4K allocation requests to split larger free spaces.

I don't think that's necessary. We still need to consider block group lock
contention, so the smallest unit should always be the group.

Having 'n' goals simply means we scan the groups 'n' times; it's not
related to the number of groups. However, when there are too many goals,
the probability of contention due to identical goals increases.
Nevertheless, this is always better than having a single goal, where they
would always contend for the same one.

Now that we're hashing based on an inode's ino, we can later specify the
corresponding inode ino based on the CPU ID during inode allocation.

I think sbi->s_groups_count / 4 is indeed acceptable. However, I don't
believe recording offsets is necessary. As groups become larger,
contention for groups will intensify, and adding offsets would only
make this contention worse.
