The divisor is going to be a power of two or a power of ten in
practice, and I think most technical users are fairly used to looking
at values scaled by those -- so I'm not convinced that this is quite as
bad as you suggest.

The choice of unit in the interface is still arbitrary, and the kernel
is already inconsistent with itself in this area, so I think userspace
is often going to have to do some scaling conversions anyway.

resctrl is not (necessarily) a user interface, but I agree that it is
no bad thing for make the output eyeball-friendly, so long is the cost
of doing so is reasonable.

(Plenty of virtual "text" files exported by the kernel are extremely
cryptic and user-hostile, though.)

If we can make the intermediate interface error-free by construction
and without making life especially hard for anyone, then that means we
can bolt whatever on at each end without having to even think about the
effect on accuracy.

I agree though that the inaccuracies introduced by the interface will
be very marginal, and likely swamped by hardware limitations and timing
skid.

Either way, it's not my call...

Cheers
