Yeah, this header test stuff is clearly not as easy as it looks. Even for
drm Jani had to fix up a few things every time this effort was restarted,
and we have very modular and clean headers and really try to make them
stand-alone. Rolling this out as a flag day change is just not realistic I
think, it's just setting yourself up for failure. I think there's two real
optiosn here:

- Gradually roll this out, ideally with support in main Kbuild so it
  doesn't have to be replicated.

- Just shoot it down and move on.

This isn't a refactoring, it's pretty substanstial change in how headers
work and how people need to treat them. And you just never change people
with a flag day approach, that doesn't ever work. And if you try, you'll
just piss of a lot of folks who are taken by surprise by your change.

Cheers, Sima
