I think the point that Miko is making here is that at some point between step 3
and 4, we could end up with up to any 3 of the original small entries as well as
the large entry in the TLB. Then the flush at step 4 will only remove the small
entry at the last entry and the large entry - i.e. it will only remove the
entries that overlap the region that the tlbi targets, and up to 3 of the small
entries may be left in the TLB after step 4. Our rationale here was that this is
safe due to BBML2 and it will naturally sort itself out over time with natural
eviction.

We need to collect the access and dirty bits so we can apply the aggregate
across all entries. We can only accurately collect the access and dirty bits if
we go via invalid, otherwise the HW could update after we have read the old
entry but before we have written the new entry.
