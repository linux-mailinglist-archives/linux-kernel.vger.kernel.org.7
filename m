Yes.

There's also the potential that there isn't a single 5V supply for the
bus, depending on the system design.

That's what I'd understood.

This is clearly not describing the hardware and therefore not a good fit
for DT.

I'm not saying this a particularly great or pleasant solution, just that
it's where things are at.  You're trying to solve an OS problem with a
firmware description which is a bit of a mismatch, ideally the firmware
descriptions would be better but that's just not how ACPI laptops work
unfortunately.

It does seem a lot easier to just mark the supplies as always on if
there's no integration with an actual client driver TBH.
