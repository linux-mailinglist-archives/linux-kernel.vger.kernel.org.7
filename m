indeed, the handler returns to the same location.
here is what the current patchset does for the signal handling.

# sorry i might be writing same things several times, but I hope
  this will help to understand/discuss what it should be.

instead of set mcontext[RIP] to userspace sa_handler, it uses
__userspace_relay_signal, which configures stack and mcontext (via
interrupt_end, setup_signal_stack_si, etc) and call userspace
sa_handler/restorer after that.

in this way, programs runs userspace sa_handler not in the host
sa_handler context.  I guess this means we don't have to configure
host register/mcontext with the userspace one ?

I agree that the current __userspace_relay_signal can be shrunk not
to call __kernel_vsyscall and focus on interrupt_end and stack
preparation.

what I meant in that example is; set host mcontext[RIP] to the fault
location, as a userspace information, which will lead to the fault
again.  But this doesn't change RIP before and after so, I guess this
isn't a good example..

thanks !

so, stub_signal_interrupt runs on a different host process.
nommu mode tries to reuse existing host sa_handler (hard_handler) to
do the job (handle SEGV etc).

If there are something missing on hard_handler and co on nommmu mode
for what userspace_tramp does on seccomp mode, I've been trying to
update it.
