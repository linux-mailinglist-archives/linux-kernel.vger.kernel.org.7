As I explained earlier in the thread, it's not *just* about the headers
being self-contained. It's *also* about checking header guards and
kernel-doc, maybe other things in the future.

If it's possible to do opt-in build checks for this, and catch all of
these pre-merge, why shouldn't we? We can catch a whole class of build
issues and bypass the subsequent fixes with this, and make life easier
for us.

Or maybe let the subsystem and driver maintainers decide?

I don't think there's a *single* header under include/drm where them
being self-contained depends on a config option. I'm sure there are
plenty in include/linux, but I wouldn't say they *all* do.

Maybe help and support us in generalizing this in scripts/Makefile.build
to avoid the boilerplate, and make Linus happy, instead of trying to
block us from having nice things? Please?
