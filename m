Right. That's why multipathd uses TEST UNIT READY if supported by the
storage, and either aio or separate I/O threads to avoid the main
thread being blocked, and generally goes to great lengths to make sure
that misbehaving storage hardware can cause no freeze.

The way I read Kevin's code, you'd queue up additional IO in the same
context that had submitted the original failing IO. I realize that qemu
uses asynchronous IO, but AFAIK the details depend on the qemu options
for the individual VM, and it isn't clear to me whether or not
DM_MPATH_PROBE_PATHS_CMD can bring the entire VM to halt.

What I meant was that dm-mpath could call fail_path() in case of an
error, using a similar mechanism to the block IO code path.

My impression from the previous discussion was that Christoph mainly
objected to SG_IO requests being retried in the kernel [1], not so much
to the inspection of the error code by device mapper.

I may have misunderstood this of course. Adding Christoph into the loop
so that he can clarify what he meant.=20

If we discuss extending SG_IO itself, it might be easier to have it
store the blkstatus_t somewhere in the sg_io_hdr. More about that idea
in my reply to Kevin.
