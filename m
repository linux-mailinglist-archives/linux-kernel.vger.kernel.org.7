I manually edited the cover letter title, but made a human error.
Thanks for the tip.

I will create a Documentation file based on what is mentioned here.

Your suggested format is more familiar. I have no objections and will
change it accordingly.

It would be good to explicitly state this in the Documentation.

Ack as I said before commenct. Thanks for suggestion again.

I will manage it separately as a logical tier that is not exposed to
users, and also handle it at the code level.

From the perspective of per-cgroup swap control,
if a ZSWAP tier is assigned and a cgroup selects that tier,
it determines whether to use zswap or not.

However, since the zswap backend does not know which tier it is linked
to, there could be a mismatch between the zswap tier (1), the backend
storage (2), and possibly another layer (3).  
This could lead to a contradiction where the cgroup-selected tier may
or may not correspond to the actual backend tier.  
Is this the correct understanding?

From what I understood when youpreviously mentioned this concept,
the “ghost swapfile” is not a real swap device.  
It exists conceptually so that zswap can operate as if there is a swap
device, but in reality, only compressed swap entries are managed by
zswap itself. (zswap needs actual swap for compress swap)

Considering both points above, could you please clarify the intended
direction?  

Are you suggesting removing the zswap tier entirely, or defining a
specific way to manage it?  

I would appreciate a bit more explanation on how you envision the zswap
tier being handled.
