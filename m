I think that the other examples should be fixed up to not do that :)

remoteproc is one example, that elf logic should all be done in
userspace, but as it's been in the tree "for forever", changing it is
not going to be possible.

Same for the existing users, changing their user/kernel api is not going
to be a simple task given that there are running systems relying on
them.

But, going forward, I think you need an explicit "this is the ONLY way
we can do this so it MUST be in the kernel" justification for adding
this type of api.  AND if that happens, THEN it should be in generic
code ONCE there are multiple users of it.

But for now, doing it in generic code, that all systems end up loading,
yet very very very few would ever actually use makes no sense.  And
adding it to a driver also doesn't make sense as you can define your
user/kernel api now, it's not set in stone at all given that there is no
existing code merged.

So again, I'm all for "do NOT do yet-another-elf-loader-in-the-kernel",
if asked.

thanks,
