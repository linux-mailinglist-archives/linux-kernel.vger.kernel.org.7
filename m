This does sound reasonable to me. I'm fine with always succeeding. I do
agree with Danilo that I would bias towards dir.file("foo_file"), but
it's not a super big deal to me.

I think the main thing I want to say here is that we should *not* force
files to be dropped before the directory, and we should also not force
child directories to be dropped before their parent directories. Trying
to impose that requirement on callers will make the API significantly
harder to use, and it's not worth it.
