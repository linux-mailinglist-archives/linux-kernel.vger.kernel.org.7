Great!

Except when debugfs is not enabled, then what are you going to return?
The same structure, or an error?

I'd vote for the same pointer to the structure, just to make it more
obvious that this is a totally opaque thing and that no caller should
ever know or care if debugfs is working or even present in the system.

Note that some drivers will want to save a bit of space if debugfs is
not enabled in the build, so be prepared to make the binding work
somehow that way too.  Can you have an "empty" object that takes no
memory?  Or is this too overthinking things?

Great!

thanks, hopefully this should make things simpler.
