Since two people were pushing the STM32 crypto engine in this thread:

I measured decryption throughput on 4 KiB messages on an STM32MP157F-DK2.  This
is an embedded evaluation board that includes an STM32 crypto engine and has an
800 MHz Cortex-A7 processor.  Cortex-A7 doesn't have AES instructions:

    AES-128-CBC-ESSIV:
        essiv(stm32-cbc-aes,sha256-arm):
            3.1 MB/s
        essiv(cbc-aes-neonbs,sha256-arm): 
            15.5 MB/s

    AES-256-XTS:
        xts(stm32-ecb-aes):
            3.1 MB/s
        xts-aes-neonbs:
            11.0 MB/s
            
    Adiantum:
        adiantum(xchacha12-arm,aes-arm,nhpoly1305-neon):
            53.1 MB/s

That was the synchronous throughput.  However, submitting multiple requests
asynchronously (which again, fscrypt doesn't actually do) barely helps.
Apparently the STM32 crypto engine has only one hardware queue.

I already strongly suspected that these non-inline crypto engines aren't worth
using.  But I didn't realize they are quite this bad.  Even with AES on a
Cortex-A7 CPU that lacks AES instructions, the CPU is much faster!

But of course Adiantum is even faster, as it was specifically designed for CPUs
that don't have AES instructions.
