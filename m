That's true. The lack of a UART or similar does make USB kinda essential 
for an input device in my opinion, though getting it working is 
Complicated for DMA reasons. (I think this is the main thing holding the 
downstream back in their rebasing efforts)

Yeah, I was just going for the closest "public" chip :) I think the PVR 
is closer to the CXe too, but all the HIDs, missing THRM, missing 
frequency scaling - it's very CL-y...

New generation upgrade? MEM1 does get used for Wii U software too, 
usually to keep framebuffers and other 3D things, so I guess they wanted 
just a little more for all the 1080p buffers the new console juggles.

The short version is "every stwcx. should be prefaced with a dcbst" - 
something to do with bus snooping (store-with-flush, store-with-kill) 
I'd guess. I have some GCC patches drafted (activated by -mcpu=espresso) 
here: https://gitlab.com/linux-wiiu/smp-patches

I'm impressed by how often IBM stuffed up atomics during this 
generation. The Xbox 360 has an extremely similar issue despite being an 
entirely different lineage of chip. No surprise the console vendors all 
went to x86 and ARM right after, I suppose.

Thanks,
Ash
