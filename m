I was curious, so I actually ran a benchmark on an Intel Emerald Rapids server.
Specifically, I used a kernel module that repeatedly en/decrypted 4096-byte
messages with AES-XTS using crypto_skcipher_en/decrypt().  That's basically what
fscrypt's file contents encryption does, but here I just measured the raw crypto
performance.  I tested both xts-aes-vaes-avx512 and qat_aes_xts.  For both, the
difference between encryption and decryption was within the margin of error, so
I'll give just one number for each.

Results:

    xts-aes-vaes-avx512: 16171 MB/s
    qat_aes_xts: 289 MB/s

So, QAT is 55 times slower than the VAES-optimized software code!

It's even slower than the generic C code:
     
    xts(ecb(aes-generic)): 305 MB/s

Now, it could be argued that this is user error -- I "should" have created lots
of asynchronous crypto requests for 4K blocks, submitted them all at once, and
waited for them to complete.  Thus allowing parallel processing by QAT.

But, that's simply not what fscrypt does.  And even if it did, it could only
plausibly help for large bios.  Short bios, for which latency is really
important, would continue to be massively regressed by using QAT for them.

Even for large bios, it would have to get over 55 times faster to be worth it,
which seems (very?) tenuous.

Also, as is known from dm-crypt which does do async processing, the code that's
needed to do it is quite complex and error-prone.

In any case, async processing would be a theoretical future improvement.  It's
simply not what fscrypt does today, or has ever done.

I also found that, even though I built the QAT driver as a loadable module, it
was loaded automatically on the system and prioritized itself over the VAES-
accelerated AES-XTS.  Thus, it would be what fscrypt uses on Intel servers where
the QAT driver is enabled in kconfig, even just as 'm'.

Even disregarding the historical data corruption issues with QAT, I think this
makes it *very* clear that the QAT driver is harmful to fscrypt users.

And I've seen similar results with the Qualcomm crypto engine
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241203180553.16893-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/).
So this isn't even unique to this particular accelerator either.

This has gone on for long enough.
