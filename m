The "start dropping events" is when committing > 1. The commit overrun
events dropping happens in rb_move_tail(), where a write falls off the end
of the sub buffer and moves the tail to the next sub-buffer. If the next
sub-buffer is the commit page, then it fails and just drops the event. This
will never happen when committing == 1.

This has nothing to do with the speed of the reader. When a event is being
written, and it gets interrupted and the interrupt starts writing events,
the interrupted event stays put. The reader could be very fast, but it will
stop when it gets to the commit page. Thus, the reader could be all caught
up, but is now waiting for new events to be committed.

If an event is interrupted, no event is fully committed until that event is
no longer interrupted and then can continue.

  rb_reserve_next_event() {
    rb_start_commit() <<-- here the reader can never go past the commit page

    [ interrupt start ]
	for (i = 0; i < 10000000000; i++)
           rb_reserve_next_event();  <<-- This will eventually fill up the
                                          buffer, but will stop when it
                                          hits the commit page and that
                                          will be when the commit overrun
                                          events start dropping.

[ On another CPU:
  ring_buffer_map_get_reader() <<-- This now gets the commit page as the
				    reader page, and there will be missed
				    events.
]
    [ interrupt end ]

    rb_end_commit() <<-- This will move the commit page forward.
}

This is a very unlikely scenario, but I can trigger it with the
perf/trace-cmd test that enables all events and function tracing with KASAN
and lockdep enabled running hackbench, as that pretty much creates the:
	for (i = 0; i < 10000000000; i++)
           rb_reserve_next_event();
scenario.

And even in that case, it triggers at most a couple of times a second:

Yes.

I think we agree here?

Thanks for the review, I'll have a new patch shortly.
