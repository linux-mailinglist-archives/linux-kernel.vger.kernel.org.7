We can play semantics if you want, but the line is *very* fine between
"mangling data" and "lying".

If the mode has been mangled, and you don't report that it has been to
userspace, are you lying?

I guess you could argue both ways, but it's really the same than what
we're discussing here. Except for the fact that one is a central part of
the uapi, that the userspace depends on, and one is a debugfs file that
*isn't* a uAPI, and the userspace really shouldn't depend on.

Then if you don't have access to it, we can just not register the
debugfs files.
