I understand your point. I don't like pulling in more FW neither but we
need to the face the following facts:

 - OTP eFuse R/W access after doing the LOCK_DOWN fuse is no longer
   possible without OP-TEE. This involves general purpose (GP) eFuses
   too. We faced this limitation in a current project.

 - With new regulations like the EU CRA I think we need some sort of
   secure-enclave anyway.

 - Making it optional cause more paths of potential errors e.g. by not
   including the correct "secure.dtsi". Multiple paths also require more
   maintain- and testing effort. IMHO I do think that one of the paths
   get unmaintened at some point but we would need to keep it for
   backward compatibility.

   Having one implementation eliminates this since.

 - All above points assume that the ELE-FW and -HW is capable of talking
   to both world, which is not the case. As we learned NXP doesn't have
   a fix for the 2-MUs ELE yet and even more important there are 1-MU
   ELE-IPs.

I do see the (minimal) drawback of having +1 FW but I think this is more
an integration problem.
Speaking of FW files, for the new i.MX9* you already have plenty fo
them: bootloader, TF-A, ele-fw, scu-fw (i.MX95). So your integation
needs to handle multiple firmware files already.

I'm not a STM32MP1 expert but here you have this setup with the
*-scmi.dtsi. So you have two code paths which needs to be maintained and
tested. Also if one customer of yours want to use OP-TEE you need the
integration anyway, so you (Kontron) needs to maintain multiple
configuration as well. I don't see the added value.

I think for STM32MP1 the *-scmi.dtsi support was added later because it
required a lot effort to support it. This is not the case for the i.MX9*
series.

  Marco
