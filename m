+1.  Please, let's not do big endian RISC-V kernels :(

This mistake was made for arm64, it's finally getting fixed.
See https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250919184025.15416-1-will@kernel.org/
Let's not make the same mistake again.

And as someone who works on optimized crypto and CRC code, the arm64 big
endian kernel support has always been really problematic.  It's rarely
tested, and code that produces incorrect outputs on arm64 big endian
regularly gets committed and released.  It sometimes gets fixed, but not
always; currently the arm64 SM3 and SM4 code produces incorrect outputs
on big endian in mainline.  (I don't really care enough to fix it, TBH.)

I recently added arm64 big endian to my own testing matrix.  But I look
forward to dropping that, as well as *not* having to start testing on
RISC-V big endian too...

Of course, that's just one example from my own experience.  There's a
lot more that CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN creates problems for.
