There are no "constraints" only a definition of a vulnerability that we
must follow.  And for that, any way that a user could cause a reboot or
panic, without having root privileges, gets assigned a CVE.

One exception being if lockdep or a few other "debugging only" options
are enabled.  Those are explicitly stated by their maintainers that they
should NEVER be enabled in a real system.  For those we do not assign
CVEs as they should never be actually triggered by a user.

So I don't know what to recommend here.  I strongly advise against
adding code to the kernel that can cause users to reboot their boxes if
they do something.  But hey, if developers want to do that, I'll gladly
assign CVEs for when it happens :)
