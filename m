Shouldn't the suspended-state of the agent be known to the SCNI server
since:

  A. the SCMI/server has somehow requested a suspend itself sending
     previously a SUSPEND SysPower notification (maybe to fulfill a
     Mnagement entity request)

OR

  B. Linux suspended itself by issuing a PSCI_SUSPEND call to EL3 which
     in turn should have notified the SCMI server os such request by
     issuing a SYSTEM_POWER_STATE_SET to the SCMI server

As in 3.4.1

"On application processors, a PSCI implementation. The PSCI implementation
fulfills OSPM calls to SYSTEM_OFF, SYSTEM_SUSPEND, SYSTEM_RESET and
SYSTEM_RESET2 functions. To do so, the PSCI implementation uses the SCMI
protocol to request system power down or reset transitions."


So how can the SCMI server be NOT aware of the current state of the OSPM
and send a second unneeded message ?

Also addressing Chuck reply later in this thread...

...why if the system is suspended, for whatever reason, and receives a
graceful shutdown notification it does NOT wakeup (due to the
notification received) and then shuwdown to fulfill the request just
received ? Is this the bug ? The wakeup-nortificatin is NOT processed
properly by the driver after it has been woke up ? 

Thanks,
Cristian
