Typically, we focus on scenarios where multiple applications switch
seamlessly=E2=80=94for instance, on a phone, when transitioning between
different apps. The smoothness of these transitions matters most,
Immediately restarting a just-terminated app isn't problematic since
its memory footprint often persists before being reclaimed.

I agree that MADV_COLD or PAGEOUT makes sense for background apps,
but I still believe process death is somewhat underestimated by you :-) In
Android, process death is actually a strong signal that an app is inactive =
and
consuming much memory=E2=80=94leading to its termination by either userspac=
e or
the kernel's OOM mechanism.

We actually took a more aggressive approach by implementing a hook to demot=
e
exclusive folios of dying apps, which yielded good results=E2=80=94reducing=
 kswapd
overhead, refaults, and thrashing. Of course, it is even much more controve=
rsial
than this patch.

While I acknowledge that counter-examples to my described pattern can alway=
s
be found, our observations clearly show that process death is a big event -=
 far
from being just a trivial unmap operation.

Anyway, not trying to push the patch as obviously it seems quite hard :-)

Thanks
Barry
