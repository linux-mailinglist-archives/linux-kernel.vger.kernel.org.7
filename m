Thank you very much for your detailed feedback and guidance! I sincerely
appreciate you taking the time to explain the correct workflow and the
options for revising the patch series.

I’ve taken your advice and resent the entire series as v3 with the
following updates:

- Incorporated the variable rename fix directly into the series.
- Propagated all relevant tags (including your Reviewed-by).
- Added complete version history with lore links for v1 and v2.

Your patience and clear instructions are incredibly helpful as I learn
the community’s processes. If there’s anything else that needs
adjustment, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ye Liu
