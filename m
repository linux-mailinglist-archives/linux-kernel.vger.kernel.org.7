Position 0x0000 is within the executable code area of standard (or
protective) MBR, and so GPT is not affected.

What about SD-card, does JH7110 loader code in MaskROM follow or ignore
this treatment?

> Position 0x0290: 40 02 00 00  00 00 20 00

Position 0x0290 is within the "must be zeroes for the rest of the block"
area of GPT header when sector size is 512 bytes. For eMMC we're working
with 512byte sectors? If eMMC was written with standard MBR then what is
this, just assumed to be somewhere inside the first partition? How does
StarFive create distro images i.e.
starfive-jh7110-202302-eMMC-minimal-desktop.img [1] for eMMC with these
prepared values, is this documented officially or in the StarFive git
repo history?

Thanks, Heinrich, helpful to know I was missing information. It does not
answer for me the question of what the logic is in the JH7110 boot code
for forming a correct test methodology. Anyway I learn a lot from this
analysis and it is much appreciated!

Hal - I would like (and/or from anyone representing StarFive) some code
listing of the JH7110 CPU MaskROM on what the SD-card and eMMC boot code
 is actually doing ... if you want this supported or you should describe
the logic flow and magic numbers, offset locations, etc. expected so I
can properly test for it. Aside, there is also a promise from 2023
January to release the supporting code for jh7110-recovery.bin SPL
utility for writing SPI NOR flash and eMMC contents [2] that should be
considered... where is the code and documentation to do what you want done?
