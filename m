Totally agree with all of this! But ideally we want the Arm ARM to be
unambiguous so that we can implement against that rather than against our
understanding of the HW issues and what the Arm ARM "almost certainly intended".

If this is just changing sizes, it's definitely, explcitly safe in the Arm ARM
(I haven't read the equivalent SMMU text). And there isn't a requirement to
flush at the end. You only need to flush the (sub-)ranges where permissions or
whatever have changed.
