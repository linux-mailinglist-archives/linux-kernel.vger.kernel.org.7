I can add checks to make sure that the call does succeed.

So after the partial unmap, the folio ends up in a little strange situation, the folio is large,
but not mapped (since large_mapcount can be 0, after all the folio_rmap_remove_ptes). Calling folio_split()
on partially unmapped fails because folio_get_anon_vma() fails due to the folio_mapped() failures
related to folio_large_mapcount. There is also additional complexity with ref counts and mapping.

Splitting during partial unmap causes recursive locking issues with anon_vma when invoked from
split_huge_pmd_locked() path. Deferred splits do not work for device private pages, due to the
migration requirements for fault handling.
