With "nohz_full=..." or "isolcpus=nohz,..." there is always at least one
housekeeping CPU. But with isolcpus=[domain] or cpusets equivalents
(v1 cpuset.sched_load_balance, v2 isolated partion) there is nothing that
prevents all CPUs from being isolated.

Speaking of, those are two different issues here:

* nohz_full CPUs are handled just like idle CPUs. Once the tick is stopped,
  the global timers are handled by other CPUs (housekeeping). There is always
  one housekeeping CPU that never goes idle.
  One subtle thing though: if the nohz_full CPU fires a tick, because there
  is a local timer to be handled for example, it will also possibly handle
  some global timers along the way. If it happens to be a problem, it should
  be easy to resolve.

* Domain isolated CPUs are treated just like other CPUs. But there is not
  always a housekeeping CPU around. And no guarantee that there is always
  a non-idle CPU to take care of global timers.

Indeed, they can definetly start there.
I'm tempted to propose to offline/reonline isolated CPUs in order to migrate
away those timers. But that only works for timers that are currently queued.

I think we can use your solution, which involves isolating the CPU from tmigr
hierarchy. And also always queue global timers to non-isolated targets.
