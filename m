Good question.

The following two problems came to my mind:

1. As John, pointed out, the fact that non-panic CPUs are not
   able to acquire the context allowed to simplify the implementation.

   I think that it is primary about nbcon_waiter_matches(),
   nbcon_owner_matches(), and the related logic. It was documented by
   the commit 8c9dab2c55ad7 ("printk: nbcon: Clarify rules of
   the owner/waiter matching").

   But it seems that nbcon_owner_matches() is safe even without the rule.
   The race is prevented either by disabling interrupts and preemption
   or by taking device_lock().

   The rule prevents a race in nbcon_waiter_matches(). But it seems
   that in the worst case, more CPUs might end up busy waiting.
   And it would be acceptable during panic().

   So, this need not be a big problem in the end.


2. If we allowed non-panic() CPUs to acquire the ownership, it would
   increase the risk that the panic CPU will not be able to
   flush the messages.

   But maybe, the problem is only when the architecture supports
   proper NMI and non-panic CPUs might be stopped anywhere.

   It should be less problem on architectures without proper NMI
   where the non-panic CPU could not be stopped in the problematic
   situation.

   So, maybe, we could relax the rule on architectures without
   proper NMI.


The question is if it is worth it. Is the clean up really important?

Note that the clean up will never be guaranteed on architectures with
a proper NMI. They would stop the non-panic CPUs, including the printk
kthread, anywhere.

And I guess that the console devices will be initialized after the
reboot anyway.

Best Regards,
Petr
