That is correct, I explicitly wanted to describe the connector and the
HPD signal therein, and at the time of merging this worked (I was even
under the impression that we do get the right HPD state at boot and
bring up the display, but it's been a while so I'm not 100% certain that
I tested that scenario).

I'm fine with dropping the hpd-gpios for reasons such that the HPD
hardware does a better job at HPD handling - but that's not what we have
here. So I share your reluctance.


PS. Using the internal HPD for detection implies that we need to keep
the DP block powered and (partially) clocked, so we should at some point
figure out how to dynamically switch between GPIO and HPD...
