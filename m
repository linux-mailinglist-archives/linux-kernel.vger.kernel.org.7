Thanks a bunch! It seems we will not need a 4th. :-)

I keep them at:

https://github.com/acmel/linux-tools-container-builds

The README should be enough to get you going, if you find some
difficulty, please lemme know.

I use this since forever and made them available at github when Daniel
Bristot started maintaining his tools in the kernels sources, the idea
was for him to also use to test build his tools.

It'll be great if you find them useful and, better, wire it up to some
sort of CI you're using.

It does a subset of what 'make -C tools/perf build-test' does, but the
idea for them is to switch to do the full build-test target and also to
run 'perf test', that would be restricted to whatever perms a the
containers are given.

Nowadays with parallel 'perf test' and it having being polished to work
with less perms, that seems like a worthy goal to pursue.

That will be really nice of you, wiring up these things so that when I
run it all goes as expected will be great!
