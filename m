Actually, I wasn't very familiar with MPI in the past. Previously, the 
implementation of sm2 was done through MPI, so I used it as well. 
Perhaps I could try using the ecc algorithm in the kernel.

Thank you for your advice, it has been very beneficial for me as I just 
started participating in the community. I will try to implement the 
functionality with more robust code and only submit parts that I fully 
understand.
