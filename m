Having the submit hold a reference to the VM_BO, and then this funny
looking bit of code in gem_close() gets us part way there:

   vm_bo =3D drm_gpuvm_bo_find(ctx->vm, obj);
   if (vm_bo) {
      drm_gpuvm_bo_put(vm_bo);
      drm_gpuvm_bo_put(vm_bo);
  }

But we still leak BO's used in other VMs.. scanout, and various other
fw and other internal BOs... those would all have to be tracked down
and to find _someplace_ to break the VM_BO  circular reference loop.

Not clear.. it would certainly make conversion to gpuvm a much bigger
flag-day, because without WEAK_REF the way gpuvm works is exactly
backwards from how the thing it is replacing works.
